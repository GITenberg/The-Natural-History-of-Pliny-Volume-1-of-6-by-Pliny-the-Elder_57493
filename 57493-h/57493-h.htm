<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> only translation of <span class="smcap">Pliny’s Natural History</span> which
has hitherto appeared in the English language is that by
Philemon Holland, published in the latter part of the reign
of Elizabeth. It is no disparagement to Holland’s merits,
as a diligent and generally faithful translator, to say that
his work is unsuited to the requirements of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>In the present translation, the principal editions of
Pliny have been carefully consulted, and no pains have
been spared, as a reference to the Notes will show, to
present to the reader the labours of recent Commentators,
among whom stands pre-eminent the celebrated Cuvier. It
has been a primary object to bring to the illustration of the
work whatever was afforded by the progress of knowledge
and modern discoveries in science and art. Without ample
illustration, Pliny’s valuable work would want much of the
interest which belongs to it, and present difficulties scarcely
surmountable by any one who has not made the Author his
especial study.</p>

<p>In the first two Books, the text of Hardouin, as given in
Lemaire’s edition (Paris, 1827), has been followed; in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
remainder that of Sillig (Gotha, 1851-3), excepting in some
few instances, where, for reasons given in the Notes, it
has been deemed advisable to depart from it. The first
two Books, and portions of others, are the performance of
the late Dr. Bostock, who contemplated a translation of
the entire work; but, unfortunately for the interests of
science, he was not permitted to carry his design into
execution.</p>

<p>Upwards of a hundred pages had been printed off before
the present Translator entered on his duties; and as they
had not the advantage of Dr. Bostock’s superintendence
through the press, some trifling oversights have occurred.
These are, for the most part, corrected in a short <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.</p>

<h2 id="THE_LIFE_AND_WRITINGS_OF_PLINY"><span class="small">THE</span><br />
<br />LIFE AND WRITINGS OF PLINY.</h2></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Caius Plinius Secundus</span> was born either at Verona or
Novum Comum<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a>, now Como, in Cisalpine Gaul, in the year
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.U.C.</span> 776, and <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 23. It is supposed that his earlier years
were spent in his native province; and that he was still a
youth when he removed to Rome, and attended the lectures
of the grammarian Apion. It was in about his sixteenth year
that he there saw Lollia Paulina<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a>, as in the following she
was divorced by Caligula, and it was probably in his twentieth
that he witnessed the capture of a large fish at Ostia,
by Claudius and his attendants<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>, and in his twenty-second
that he visited Africa<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a>, Egypt, and Greece.</p>

<p>In his twenty-third year Pliny served in Germany under
the legatus Pomponius Secundus, whose friendship he soon
acquired, and was in consequence promoted to the command
of an <em>ala</em>, or troop of cavalry. During his military career
he wrote a treatise (now lost) “On the Use of the Javelin
by Cavalry,” and travelled over that country<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> as far as
the shores of the German Ocean, besides visiting Belgic
Gaul. In his twenty-ninth year he returned to Rome,
and applied himself for a time to forensic pursuits, which
however he appears soon to have abandoned. About this
time he wrote the life of his friend Pomponius, and an
account of the “Wars in Germany,” in twenty books,
neither of which are extant. Though employed in writing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
continuation of the “Roman History” of Aufidius Bassus, from
the time of Tiberius, he judiciously suspended its publication
during the reign of Nero, who appointed him his procurator
in Nearer Spain, and not improbably honoured him with
equestrian rank. It was during his sojourn in Spain that the
death of his brother-in-law, C. Cæcilius, left his nephew C.
Plinius Cæcilius Secundus (the author of the Letters) an orphan;
whom immediately upon his return to Rome, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 70, he
adopted, receiving him and his widowed mother under his roof.</p>

<p>Having been previously known to Vespasian in the
German wars, he was admitted into the number of his
most intimate friends, and obtained an appointment at court,
the nature of which is not known, but Rezzonico conjectures
that it was in connexion with the imperial treasury.
Though Pliny was on intimate terms also with Titus, to
whom he dedicated his Natural History, there is little
ground for the assertion, sometimes made, that he served
under him in the Jewish wars. His account of Palestine
clearly shows that he had never visited that country. It
was at this period that he published his Continuation of the
History of Aufidius Bassus.</p>

<p>From the titles which he gives to Titus in the dedicatory
preface, it is pretty clear that his Natural History was published
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 77, two years before his death.</p>

<p>In <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 73 or 74, he had been appointed by Vespasian
præfect of the Roman fleet at Misenum, on the western coast
of Italy. It was to this elevation that he owed his romantic
death, somewhat similar, it has been remarked, to that of
Empedocles, who perished in the crater of Mount Ætna.
The closing scene of his active life, simultaneously with the
destruction of Herculaneum and Pompeii, cannot be better
described than in the language employed by his nephew in
an Epistle to his friend Tacitus the historian<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>:—“My uncle
was at Misenum, where he was in personal command of the
fleet. On the ninth<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> day before the calends of September, at
about the seventh hour, 1 <span class="smcap lowercase">P.M.</span>, my mother, observing the appearance
of a cloud of unusual size and shape, mentioned it to
him. After reclining in the sun he had taken his cold
bath; he had then again lain down and, after a slight repast,
applied himself to his studies. Immediately upon hearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
this, he called for his shoes, and ascended a spot from
which he could more easily observe this remarkable phænomenon.
The cloud was to be seen gradually rising upwards;
though, from the great distance, it was uncertain
from which of the mountains it arose; it was afterwards,
however, ascertained to be Vesuvius. In appearance and
shape it strongly resembled a tree; perhaps it was more like
a pine than anything else, with a stem of enormous length
reaching upwards to the heavens, and then spreading out in
a number of branches in every direction. I have little doubt
that either it had been carried upwards by a violent gust of
wind, and that the wind dying away, it had lost its compactness,
or else, that being overcome by its own weight, it
had decreased in density and become extended over a large
surface: at one moment it was white, at another dingy and
spotted, just as it was more or less charged with earth or
with ashes.</p>

<p>“To a man so eager as he was in the pursuit of knowledge,
this appeared to be a most singular phænomenon, and one that
deserved to be viewed more closely; accordingly he gave
orders for a light Liburnian vessel to be got ready, and left
it at my option to accompany him. To this however I made
answer, that I should prefer continuing my studies; and as
it so happened, he himself had just given me something to
write. Taking his tablets with him, he left the house. The
sailors stationed at Retina, alarmed at the imminence of the
danger—for the village lay at the foot of the mountain,
and the sole escape was by sea—sent to entreat his assistance
in rescuing them from this frightful peril. Upon this
he instantly changed his plans, and what he had already
begun from a desire for knowledge, he determined to carry
out as a matter of duty. He had the gallies put to sea at once,
and went on board himself, with the intention of rendering assistance,
not only to Retina, but to many other places as well;
for the whole of this charming coast was thickly populated.
Accordingly he made all possible haste towards the spot,
from which others were flying, and steered straight onwards
into the very midst of the danger: so far indeed was he
from every sensation of fear, that he remarked and had
noted down every movement and every change that was to
be observed in the appearance of this ominous eruption.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
The ashes were now falling fast upon the vessels, hotter
and more and more thickly the nearer they approached the
shore; showers of pumice too, intermingled with black
stones, calcined and broken by the action of the flames:
the sea suddenly retreated from the shore, where the debris
of the mountain rendered landing quite impossible. After
hesitating for a moment whether or not to turn back, upon
the pilot strongly advising him to do so:—“Fortune favours
the bold<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a>,” said he, “conduct me to Pomponianus.” Pomponianus
was then at Stabiæ, a place that lay on the other
side of the bay, for in those parts the shores are winding,
and as they gradually trend away, the sea forms a number
of little creeks. At this spot the danger at present was not
imminent, but still it could be seen, and as it appeared to be
approaching nearer and nearer, Pomponianus had ordered
his baggage on board the ships, determined to take to
flight, if the wind, which happened to be blowing the other
way, should chance to lull. The wind, being in this quarter,
was extremely favourable to his passage, and my uncle soon
arriving at Stabiæ, embraced his anxious friend, and did his
best to restore his courage; and the better to re-assure him
by evidence of his own sense of their safety, he requested the
servants to conduct him to the bath. After bathing he took
his place at table, and dined, and that too in high spirits, or
at all events, what equally shows his strength of mind, with
every outward appearance of being so. In the mean time
vast sheets of flame and large bodies of fire were to be seen
arising from Mount Vesuvius; the glare and brilliancy of
which were beheld in bolder relief as the shades of night
came on apace. My uncle however, in order to calm their
fears, persisted in saying that this was only the light given
by some villages which had been abandoned by the rustics
in their alarm to the flames: after which he retired to rest,
and soon fell fast asleep: for his respiration, which with him
was heavy and loud, in consequence of his corpulence, was
distinctly heard by the servants who were keeping watch at
the door of the apartment. The courtyard which led to his
apartment had now become filled with cinders and pumice-stones,
to such a degree, that if he had remained any longer
in the room, it would have been quite impossible for him to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">xi</span>
leave it. On being awoke he immediately arose, and rejoined
Pomponianus and the others who had in the meanwhile
been sitting up. They then consulted together whether
it would be better to remain in the house or take their
chance in the open air; as the building was now rocking to
and fro from the violent and repeated shocks, while the walls,
as though rooted up from their very foundations, seemed
to be at one moment carried in this direction, at another
in that. Having adopted the latter alternative, they were
now alarmed at the showers of light calcined pumice-stones
that were falling thick about them, a risk however to which
as a choice of evils they had to submit. In taking this step
I must remark that, while with my uncle it was reason triumphing
over reason, with the rest it was only one fear
getting the better of the other. Taking the precaution of
placing pillows on their heads, they tied them on with towels,
by way of protection against the falling stones and ashes.
It was now day in other places, though there it was still
night, more dark and more profound than any ordinary night;
torches however and various lights in some measure served
to dispel the gloom. It was then determined to make for
the shore, and to ascertain whether the sea would now admit
of their embarking; it was found however to be still too
stormy and too boisterous to allow of their making the attempt.
Upon this my uncle lay down on a sail which had
been spread for him, and more than once asked for some
cold water, which he drank; very soon however, they were
alarmed by the flames and the sulphurous smell which announced
their approach, upon which the others at once took to
flight, while my uncle arose leaning upon two of the servants
for support. Upon making this effort, he instantly fell to
the ground; the dense vapour having, I imagine, stopped the
respiration and suffocated him; for his chest was naturally
weak and contracted, and often troubled with violent palpitations.
When day was at last restored, the third after the
closing one of his existence, his body was found untouched
and without a wound; there was no change to be perceived
in the clothes, and its appearance was rather that of a person
asleep than of a corpse. In the meantime my mother
and myself were at Misenum—that however has nothing
to do with the story, as it was only your wish to know the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">xii</span>
details connected with his death. I shall therefore draw to
a conclusion. The only thing that I shall add is the assurance
that I have truthfully related all these facts, of which
I was either an eye-witness myself, or heard them at the
time of their occurrence, a period when they were most
likely to be correctly related. You of course will select
such points as you may think the most important. For it
is one thing to write a letter, another to write history;—one
thing to write for a friend, another to write for the public.
Farewell.”</p>

<p>Of the mode of life pursued by Pliny, and of the rest of
his works, an equally interesting account has been preserved
by his nephew, in an Epistle addressed to Macer<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a>.
We cannot more appropriately conclude than by presenting
this Epistle to the reader:—“I am highly gratified to
find that you read the works of my uncle with such a
degree of attention as to feel a desire to possess them
all, and that with this view you inquire, What are their
names? I will perform the duties of an index then: and
not content with that, will state in what order they were
written: for even that is a kind of information which is by no
means undesirable to those who are devoted to literary pursuits.
His first composition was a treatise ‘on the use of
the Javelin by Cavalry,’ in one Book. This he composed,
with equal diligence and ingenuity, while he was in command
of a troop of horse. His second work was the ‘Life
of Q. Pomponius Secundus,’ in two Books, a person by whom
he had been particularly beloved.—These books he composed
as a tribute which was justly due to the memory of his deceased
friend. His next work was twenty Books on ‘the
Wars in Germany,’ in which he has compiled an account of
all the wars in which we have been engaged with the people
of that country. This he had begun while serving in
Germany, having been recommended to do so in a dream.
For in his sleep he thought that the figure of Drusus
Nero<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> stood by him—the same Drusus, who after the
most extensive conquests in that country, there met his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">xiii</span>
death. Commending his memory to Pliny’s attentive care,
Drusus conjured him to rescue it from the decaying effect
of oblivion. Next to these came his three books entitled ‘The
Student’<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>, divided, on account of their great size, into six
volumes. In these he has given instructions for the training
of the orator, from the cradle to his entrance on public
life. In the latter years of Nero’s reign, he wrote eight
books, ‘On Difficulties in the Latin Language<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a>;’ that being
a period at which every kind of study, in any way free-spoken
or even of elevated style, would have been rendered dangerous
by the tyranny that was exercised. His next work was
his ‘Continuation of the History of Aufidius Bassus,’ in
thirty-one books; after which came his ‘Natural History,’
in thirty-seven books, a work remarkable for its comprehensiveness
and erudition, and not less varied than Nature herself.
You will wonder how a man so occupied with business
could possibly find time to write such a number of volumes,
many of them on subjects of a nature so difficult to be
treated of. You will be even more astonished when you
learn, that for some time he pleaded at the bar as an advocate,
that he was only in his fifty-sixth year at the time of
his death, and that the time that intervened was equally
trenched upon and frittered away by the most weighty duties
of business, and the marks of favour shewn him by princes.
His genius, however, was truly quite incredible, his zeal
indefatigable, and his power of application wonderful in the
extreme. At the festival of the Vulcanalia<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a>, he began to
sit up to a late hour by candle-light, not for the purpose of
consulting<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> the stars, but with the object of pursuing his
studies; while, in the winter, he would set to work at the
seventh hour of the night, or the eighth at the very latest,
often indeed at the sixth<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a>. By nature he had the faculty of
being able to fall asleep in a moment; indeed, slumber would
sometimes overtake him in his studies, and then leave him
just as suddenly. Before daybreak, he was in the habit of
attending the Emperor Vespasian,—for he, too, was one who
made an excellent use of his nights,—and then betook himself<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">xiv</span>
to the duties with which he was charged. On his return
home, he devoted all the time which was still remaining
to study. Taking an early repast, after the old fashion,
light, and easy of digestion, in the summer time, if he had
any leisure to spare, he would lie down in the sun-shine,
while some book was read to him, he himself making notes
and extracts in the meanwhile; for it was his habit never to
read anything without making extracts, it being a maxim of
his, that there is no book so bad but that some good may be
got out of it. After thus enjoying the sunshine, he generally
took a cold bath; after which he would sit down to a
slight repast, and then take a short nap. On awaking, as
though another day had now commenced, he would study
till the hour for the evening meal, during which some book
was generally read to him, he making comments on it in a
cursory manner. I remember, on one occasion, a friend of
his interrupting the reader, who had given the wrong pronunciation
to some words, and making him go over them
again. “You understood him, didn’t you?” said my uncle.
“Yes,” said the other. “Why, then, did you make him go
over it again? Through this interruption of yours, we have
lost more than ten lines.” So thrifty a manager was he of
time! In summer he rose from the evening meal by daylight;
and, in winter, during the first hour of the night<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a>,
just as though there had been some law which made it compulsory
on him to do so. This is how he lived in the midst
of his employments, and the bustle of the city. When in
retirement in the country, the time spent in the bath was
the only portion that was not allotted by him to study.
When I say in the bath, I mean while he was in the water;
for while his body was being scraped with the strigil and
rubbed, he either had some book read to him, or else would
dictate himself. While upon a journey, as though relieved
from every other care, he devoted himself to study, and nothing
else. By his side was his secretary, with a book and
tablets; and, in the winter time, the secretary’s hands were
protected by gloves, that the severity of the weather might
not deprive his master for a single moment of his services.
It was for this reason also that, when at Rome, he would
never move about except in a litter. I remember that on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xv">xv</span>
one occasion he found fault with me for walking—“You
might have avoided losing all those hours,” said he; for he
looked upon every moment as lost which was not devoted to
study. It was by means of such unremitting industry as
this that he completed so many works, and left me 160
volumes of notes<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>, written extremely small on both sides,
which in fact renders the collection doubly voluminous.
He himself used to relate, that when he was procurator in
Spain, he might have parted with his common-place book to
Largius Licinius for 400,000 sesterces; and at that time the
collection was not so extensive as afterwards. When you
come to think of how much he must have read, of how much
he has written, would you not really suppose that he had
never been engaged in business, and had never enjoyed the
favour of princes? And yet, on the other hand, when you
hear what labour he expended upon his studies, does it not
almost seem that he has neither written nor read enough?
For, in fact, what pursuits are those that would not have
been interrupted by occupations such as his? While, again,
what is there that such unremitting perseverance as his
could not have effected? I am in the habit, therefore, of
laughing at it when people call me a studious man,—me
who, in comparison with him, am a downright idler; and
yet I devote to study as much time as my public engagements
on the one hand, and my duties to my friends on the
other, will admit of. Who is there, then, out of all those
who have devoted their whole life to literature, that ought
not, when put in comparison with him, to quite blush at a
life that would almost appear to have been devoted to
slothfulness and inactivity? But my letter has already
exceeded its proper limits, for I had originally intended to
write only upon the subject as to which you made inquiry,
the books of his composition that he left. I trust, however,
that these particulars will prove no less pleasing to you than
the writings themselves; and that they will not only induce
you to peruse them, but excite you, by a feeling of generous
emulation, to produce some work of a similar nature.—Farewell.”</p>

<p>Of all the works written by Pliny, one only, the ‘Historia
Naturalis’ has survived to our times. This work, however, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">xvi</span>
is not a ‘Natural History’ in the modern acceptation of
the term, but rather a vast Encyclopædia of ancient knowledge
and belief upon almost every known subject—“not
less varied than Nature herself,” as his nephew says. It
comprises, within the compass of thirty-seven books, 20,000
matters of importance, collected from about 2000 volumes
(nearly all of which have now perished), the works, as Pliny
himself states, of 100 writers of authority; together with
a vast number of additional matters unknown to those authorities,
and many of them the results of his own experience
and observation. Hardouin has drawn up a catalogue
of the authors quoted by Pliny; they amount in
number to between 400 and 500.</p>

<p>The following is a brief sketch of the plan of this wonderful
monument of human industry. After a dedicatory Epistle to
Titus, followed by a table of contents of the other Books, which
together form the First Book, the author proceeds to give
an account of the prevailing notions as to the universe, the
earth, the sun, the moon, the stars, and the more remarkable
properties of the elements (<em>partes naturæ</em>). He then passes
on to a geographical description of the face of the earth as
known to the ancients. After the Geography comes what may
in strict propriety be termed “Natural History,” including
a history of man, replete indeed with marvels, but interesting
in the highest degree. Having mentioned at considerable
length the land, animals, fishes, birds, and insects,
he passes on to Botany, which in its various aspects occupies
the larger portion of the work. At the same time,
in accordance with his comprehensive plan, this part
includes a vast amount of information on numerous subjects,
the culture of the cereals and the manufacture of oil, wine,
paper (<em>papyrus</em>), and numerous other articles of daily use.
After treating at considerable length of Medical Botany,
he proceeds to speak of medicaments derived from the human
body, from which he branches off into discussions on the
history of medicine, and magic, which last he looks upon as
an offshoot from the medical art; and he takes this opportunity
of touching upon many of the then current superstitions
and notions on astrology. He concludes this portion
of his work with an account of the medicinal properties of
various waters, and of those of fishes and other aquatic animals.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">xvii</span>
He then presents us with a treatise on Mineralogy, in
which he has accumulated every possible kind of information
relative to the use of gold, silver, bronze, and
other metals; a subject which not unnaturally leads him
into repeated digressions relative to money, jewels, plate,
statues, and statuaries. Mineral pigments next occupy his
attention, with many interesting notices of the great painters
of Greece; from which he passes on to the various kinds of
stone and materials employed in building, and the use of
marble for the purposes of sculpture, including a notice of
that art and of the most eminent sculptors. The last Book
is devoted to an account of gems and precious stones, and
concludes with an eulogium on his native country, as alike
distinguished for its fertility, its picturesque beauties, and
the natural endowments and high destinies of its people.</p>

<p>From the writings of Pliny we gather of course a large
amount of information as to his opinions and the constitution
of his mind. His credulity, it must be admitted, is great in
the extreme; though, singularly enough, he severely taxes the
Greeks with the same failing<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>. Were we not assured from
other sources that he was eminently successful in life, was in
the enjoyment of opulence, and honoured with the favour and
confidence of princes<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>, the remarks which he frequently
makes on human life, in the Seventh Book more especially,
would have led us to the conclusion that he was a disappointed
man, embittered against his fellow-creatures, and
dissatisfied with the terms on which the tenure of life is
granted to us. He opens that Book with a preface replete
with querulous dissatisfaction and repinings at the lot of
man—the only ‘tearful’ animal—he says<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a>. He repines at
the helpless and wretched condition of the infant at the
moment it is ushered into life, and the numerous pains and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">xviii</span>
vices to which it is doomed to be subject.—Man’s liability
to disease is with him a blemish in the economy of nature:—“life,”
he says, “this gift of nature, however long it
may be, is but too uncertain and too frail; to those
even to whom it is most largely granted, it is dealt out with
a sparing and niggardly hand, if we only think of eternity<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a>.”
As we cannot have life on our own terms, he does not think
it worthy of our acceptance, and more than once expresses
his opinion that the sooner we are rid of it the better. Sudden
death he looks upon as a remarkable phænomenon, but, at
the same time, as the greatest blessing that can be granted to
us<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>: and when he mentions cases of resuscitation, it is only
to indulge in the querulous complaint, that, “exposed as he
is by his birth to the caprices of fortune, man can be certain
of nothing; no, not even his own death<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>.” Though anything
but<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> an Epicurean, in the modern acceptation of the
word, he seems to have held some, at least, of the tenets
of Epicurus, in reference to the immortality of the soul.
Whether he supposed that the soul, at the moment of death,
is resolved into its previous atoms or constituent elements,
he does not inform us; but he states it as his belief, that
after death the soul has no more existence than it had before
birth; that all notions of immortality are a mere delusion<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>;
and that the very idea of a future existence is ridiculous,
and spoils that greatest<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a> blessing of nature—death. He
certainly speaks of ghosts or apparitions, seen after death;
but these he probably looked upon as exceptional cases, if
indeed he believed<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> in the stories which he quotes, of which
we have no proofs, or rather, indeed, presumptive proofs to
the contrary; for some of them he calls “magna<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> fabulosetas,”
“most fabulous tales.”</p>

<p>In relation to human inventions, it is worthy of remark, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xix">xix</span>
that he states that the first<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> thing in which mankind agreed,
was the use of the Ionian alphabet; the second, the practice
of shaving<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> the beard, and the employment of barbers; and
the third, the division of time into hours.</p>

<p>We cannot more appropriately conclude this review of
the Life and Works of Pliny, than by quoting the opinions
of two of the most eminent philosophers of modern times,
Buffon and Cuvier; though the former, it must be admitted,
has spoken of him in somewhat too high terms of commendation,
and in instituting a comparison between Pliny’s work
and those of Aristotle, has placed in juxtaposition the names
of two men who, beyond an ardent thirst for knowledge, had
no characteristics in common.</p>

<p>“Pliny,” says Buffon<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a>, “has worked upon a plan which
is much more extensive than that of Aristotle, and not improbably
too extensive. He has made it his object to embrace
every subject; indeed he would appear to have taken
the measure of Nature, and to have found her too contracted
for his expansive genius. His ‘Natural History,’ independently
of that of animals, plants, and minerals, includes
an account of the heavens and the earth, of medicine, commerce,
navigation, the liberal and mechanical arts, the
origin of usages and customs, in a word, the history of all the
natural sciences and all the arts of human invention. What,
too, is still more astonishing, in each of these departments
Pliny shows himself equally great. The grandeur of his
ideas and the dignity of his style confer an additional lustre
on the profoundness of his erudition; not only did he know
all that was known in his time, but he was also gifted with
that comprehensiveness of view which in some measure multiplies
knowledge. He had all that delicacy of perception
upon which depend so materially both elegance and taste,
and he communicates to his readers that freedom of thought
and that boldness of sentiment, which constitute the true
germ of philosophy. His work, as varied as Nature herself,
always paints her in her most attractive colours. It is, so to
say, a compilation from all that had been written before his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xx">xx</span>
time: a record of all that was excellent or useful; but this
record has in it features so grand, this compilation contains
matter grouped in a manner so novel, that it is preferable to
most of the original works that treat upon similar subjects.”</p>

<p>The judgment pronounced by Cuvier on Pliny’s work,
though somewhat less highly coloured, awards to it a high
rank among the most valuable productions of antiquity.
“The work of Pliny<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>,” says he, “is one of the most precious
monuments that have come down to us from ancient times,
and affords proof of an astonishing amount of erudition in
one who was a warrior and a statesman. To appreciate
with justice this vast and celebrated composition, it is
necessary to regard it in several points of view—with reference
to the plan proposed, the facts stated, and the
style employed. The plan proposed by the writer is of
immense extent—it is his object to write not merely a
Natural History in our restricted sense of the term, not
an account merely, more or less detailed, of animals, plants,
and minerals, but a work which embraces astronomy, physics,
geography, agriculture, commerce, medicine, and the
fine arts—and all these in addition to natural history properly
so called; while at the same time he continually
interweaves with his narrative information upon the arts
which bear relation to man considered metaphysically, and
the history of nations,—so much so indeed, that in many
respects this work was the Encyclopædia of its age. It was
impossible in running over, however cursorily, such a prodigious
number of subjects, that the writer should not have
made us acquainted with a multitude of facts, which, while
remarkable in themselves, are the more precious from the
circumstance that at the present day he is the only author
extant who relates them. It is to be regretted however that
the manner in which he has collected and grouped this
mass of matter, has caused it to lose some portion of its
value, from his mixture of fable with truth, and more especially
from the difficulty, and in some cases, the impossibility,
of discovering exactly of what object<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> he is speaking.
But if Pliny possesses little merit as a critic, it is far otherwise<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xxi">xxi</span>
with his talent as a writer, and the immense treasury
which he opens to us of Latin terms and forms of expression:
these, from the very abundance of the subjects upon
which he treats, render his work one of the richest repositories
of the Roman language. Wherever he finds it possible
to give expression to general ideas or to philosophical views,
his language assumes considerable energy and vivacity, and
his thoughts present to us a certain novelty and boldness
which tend in a very great degree to relieve the dryness of
his enumerations, and, with the majority of his readers, excuse
the insufficiency of his scientific indications. He is
always noble and serious, full of the love of justice and
virtue, detestation of cruelty and baseness, of which he
had such frightful instances before his eyes, and contempt
for that unbridled luxury which in his time had
so deeply corrupted the Roman people. For these great
merits Pliny cannot be too highly praised, and despite the
faults which we are obliged to admit in him when viewed as
a naturalist, we are bound to regard him as one of the most
meritorious of the Roman writers, and among those most
worthy to be reckoned in the number of the classics who
wrote after the reign of Augustus.”</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="larger">T</span><span class="smcap">his</span> treatise on Natural History, a novel work in Roman
literature, which I have just completed, I have taken the
liberty to dedicate to you, most gracious<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> Emperor, an appellation
peculiarly suitable to you, while, on account of his
age, that of <em>great</em> is more appropriate to your Father;—</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>if I may be allowed to shelter myself under the example of
Catullus, my fellow-countryman<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>, a military term, which you
well understand. For he, as you know, when his napkins
had been changed<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>, expressed himself a little harshly, from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
his anxiety to show his friendship for his dear little <em>Veranius</em>
and <em>Fabius</em><a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>. At the same time this my importunity may
effect, what you complained of my not having done in another
too forward epistle of mine; it will put upon record,
and let all the world know, with what kindness you exercise
the imperial dignity. You, who have had the honour of a
triumph, and of the censorship, have been six times consul,
and have shared in the tribunate; and, what is still more
honourable, whilst you held them in conjunction with your
Father, you have presided over the Equestrian order, and
been the Prefect of the Prætorians<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>: all this you have done
for the service of the Republic, and, at the same time, have
regarded me as a fellow-soldier and a messmate. Nor has
the extent of your prosperity produced any change in you,
except that it has given you the power of doing good to the
utmost of your wishes. And whilst all these circumstances
increase the veneration which other persons feel for you,
with respect to myself, they have made me so bold, as to wish
to become more familiar. You must, therefore, place this
to your own account, and blame yourself for any fault of this
kind that I may commit.</p>

<p>But, although I have laid aside my blushes<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a>, I have not
gained my object; for you still awe me, and keep me at a
distance, by the majesty of your understanding. In no one
does the force of eloquence and of tribunitian oratory blaze
out more powerfully! With what glowing language do you
thunder forth the praises of your Father! How dearly do
you love your Brother! How admirable is your talent for
poetry! What a fertility of genius do you possess, so as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
enable you to imitate your Brother<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>! But who is there that
is bold enough to form an estimate on these points, if he is
to be judged by you, and, more especially, if you are challenged
to do so? For the case of those who merely publish
their works is very different from that of those who expressly
dedicate them to you. In the former case I might
say, Emperor! why do you read these things? They are
written only for the common people, for farmers or mechanics,
or for those who have nothing else to do; why do you
trouble yourself with them? Indeed, when I undertook
this work, I did not expect that you would sit in judgement
upon me<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>; I considered your situation much too elevated
for you to descend to such an office. Besides, we possess the
right of openly rejecting the opinion of men of learning.
M. Tullius himself, whose genius is beyond all competition,
uses this privilege; and, remarkable as it may appear, employs
an advocate in his own defence:—“I do not write for
very learned people; I do not wish my works to be read by
Manius Persius, but by Junius Congus<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>.” And if Lucilius,
who first introduced the satirical style<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a>, applied such a remark
to himself, and if Cicero thought proper to borrow it,
and that more especially in his treatise “De Republica,”
how much reason have I to do so, who have such a judge to
defend myself against! And by this dedication I have deprived
myself of the benefit of challenge<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>; for it is a very
different thing whether a person has a judge given him by
lot, or whether he voluntarily selects one; and we always
make more preparation for an invited guest, than for one
that comes in unexpectedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>When the candidates for office, during the heat of the
canvass, deposited the fine<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> in the hands of Cato, that determined
opposer of bribery, rejoicing as he did in his being
rejected from what he considered to be foolish honours, they
professed to do this out of respect to his integrity; the
greatest glory which a man could attain. It was on this
occasion that Cicero uttered the noble ejaculation, “How
happy are you, Marcus Porcius, of whom no one dares to
ask what is dishonourable<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>!” When L. Scipio Asiaticus
appealed to the tribunes, among whom was Gracchus, he
expressed full confidence that he should obtain an acquittal,
even from a judge who was his enemy. Hence it follows,
that he who appoints his own judge must absolutely submit
to the decision; this choice is therefore termed an appeal<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>.</p>

<p>I am well aware, that, placed as you are in the highest
station, and gifted with the most splendid eloquence and
the most accomplished mind, even those who come to pay
their respects to you, do it with a kind of veneration: on
this account I ought to be careful that what is dedicated to
you should be worthy of you. But the country people, and,
indeed, some whole nations offer milk to the Gods<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a>, and those
who cannot procure frankincense substitute in its place salted
cakes; for the Gods are not dissatisfied when they are worshiped
by every one to the best of his ability. But my
temerity will appear the greater by the consideration, that
these volumes, which I dedicate to you, are of such inferior
importance. For they do not admit of the display of genius,
nor, indeed, is mine one of the highest order; they admit of
no excursions, nor orations, nor discussions, nor of any wonderful
adventures, nor any variety of transactions, nor, from
the barrenness of the matter, of anything particularly pleasant
in the narration, or agreeable to the reader. The nature<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of things, and life as it actually exists, are described in
them; and often the lowest department of it; so that, in
very many cases, I am obliged to use rude and foreign, or
even barbarous terms, and these often require to be introduced
by a kind of preface. And, besides this, my road is
not a beaten track, nor one which the mind is much disposed
to travel over. There is no one among us who has ever attempted
it, nor is there any one individual among the Greeks
who has treated of all the topics. Most of us seek for nothing
but amusement in our studies, while others are fond
of subjects that are of excessive subtilty, and completely involved
in obscurity. My object is to treat of all those things
which the Greeks include in the Encyclopædia<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>, which, however,
are either not generally known or are rendered dubious
from our ingenious conceits. And there are other matters
which many writers have given so much in detail that we
quite loathe them. It is, indeed, no easy task to give novelty
to what is old, and authority to what is new; brightness to
what is become tarnished, and light to what is obscure; to
render what is slighted acceptable, and what is doubtful
worthy of our confidence; to give to all a natural manner,
and to each its peculiar nature. It is sufficiently honourable
and glorious to have been willing even to make the attempt,
although it should prove unsuccessful. And, indeed,
I am of opinion, that the studies of those are more especially
worthy of our regard, who, after having overcome all difficulties,
prefer the useful office of assisting others to the
mere gratification of giving pleasure; and this is what I have
already done in some of my former works. I confess it surprises
me, that T. Livius, so celebrated an author as he is,
in one of the books of his history of the city from its origin,
should begin with this remark, “I have now obtained a sufficient
reputation, so that I might put an end to my work,
did not my restless mind require to be supported by employment<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>.”
Certainly he ought to have composed this work,
not for his own glory, but for that of the Roman name, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
of the people who were the conquerors of all other nations.
It would have been more meritorious to have persevered in
his labours from his love of the work, than from the gratification
which it afforded himself, and to have accomplished
it, not for his own sake, but for that of the Roman people.</p>

<p>I have included in thirty-six<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> books 20,000 topics, all
worthy of attention, (for, as Domitius Piso<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> says, we ought
to make not merely books, but valuable collections,) gained
by the perusal of about 2000 volumes, of which a few only
are in the hands of the studious, on account of the obscurity
of the subjects, procured by the careful perusal of 100 select
authors<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>; and to these I have made considerable additions
of things, which were either not known to my predecessors,
or which have been lately discovered. Nor can I doubt
but that there still remain many things which I have omitted;
for I am a mere mortal, and one that has many occupations.
I have, therefore, been obliged to compose this work at interrupted
intervals, indeed during the night, so that you will
find that I have not been idle even during this period. The
day I devote to you, exactly portioning out my sleep to the
necessity of my health, and contenting myself with this reward,
that while we are musing<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> on these subjects (according
to the remark of Varro), we are adding to the length of
our lives; for life properly consists in being awake.</p>

<p>In consideration of these circumstances and these difficulties,
I dare promise nothing; but you have done me the
most essential service in permitting me to dedicate my work
to you. Nor does this merely give a sanction to it, but it
determines its value; for things are often conceived to be of
great value, solely because they are consecrated in temples.</p>

<p>I have given a full account of all your family—your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Father, yourself, and your Brother, in a history of our own
times, beginning where Aufidius Bassus concludes<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>. You
will ask, Where is it? It has been long completed and its
accuracy confirmed<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a>; but I have determined to commit the
charge of it to my heirs, lest I should have been suspected,
during my lifetime, of having been unduly influenced by
ambition. By this means I confer an obligation on those
who occupy the same ground with myself; and also on
posterity, who, I am aware, will contend with me, as I have
done with my predecessors.</p>

<p>You may judge of my taste from my having inserted, in
the beginning of my book, the names of the authors that I
have consulted. For I consider it to be courteous and to
indicate an ingenuous modesty, to acknowledge the sources
whence we have derived assistance, and not to act as most
of those have done whom I have examined. For I must
inform you, that in comparing various authors with each
other, I have discovered, that some of the most grave and of
the latest writers have transcribed, word for word, from
former works, without making any acknowledgement; not
avowedly rivalling them, in the manner of Virgil, or with
the candour of Cicero, who, in his treatise “De Republica<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>,”
professes to coincide in opinion with Plato, and in his Essay
on Consolation for his Daughter, says that he follows
Crantor, and, in his Offices<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>, Panæcius; volumes, which, as you
well know, ought not merely to be always in our hands, but
to be learned by heart. For it is indeed the mark of a perverted
mind and a bad disposition, to prefer being caught in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
a theft to returning what we have borrowed, especially
when we have acquired capital, by usurious interest<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>.</p>

<p>The Greeks were wonderfully happy in their titles. One
work they called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κηρίον</span>, which means that it was as sweet
as a honeycomb; another <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Κέρας Ἀμαλθείας</span>, or Cornu copiæ,
so that you might expect to get even a draught of pigeon’s
milk from it<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>. Then they have their Flowers, their Muses,
Magazines, Manuals, Gardens, Pictures, and Sketches<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a>, all
of them titles for which a man might be tempted even to
forfeit his bail. But when you enter upon the works, O
ye Gods and Goddesses! how full of emptiness! Our duller
countrymen have merely their Antiquities, or their Examples,
or their Arts. I think one of the most humorous of them has
his Nocturnal Studies<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a>, a term employed by Bibaculus; a name
which he richly deserved<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>. Varro, indeed, is not much behind
him, when he calls one of his satires A Trick and a Half,
and another Turning the Tables<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a>. Diodorus was the first
among the Greeks who laid aside this trifling manner and
named his history The Library<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>. Apion, the grammarian,
indeed—he whom Tiberius Cæsar called the Trumpeter of
the World, but would rather seem to be the Bell of the
Town-crier<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>,—supposed that every one to whom he inscribed
any work would thence acquire immortality. I do not regret
not having given my work a more fanciful title.</p>

<p>That I may not, however, appear to inveigh so completely
against the Greeks, I should wish to be considered under
the same point of view with those inventors of the arts of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
painting and sculpture, of whom you will find an account
in these volumes, whose works, although they are so perfect
that we are never satisfied with admiring them, are inscribed
with a temporary title<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>, such as “Apelles, or Polycletus, was
doing this;” implying that the work was only commenced
and still imperfect, and that the artist might benefit by the
criticisms that were made on it and alter any part that
required it, if he had not been prevented by death. It is
also a great mark of their modesty, that they inscribed their
works as if they were the last which they had executed, and
as still in hand at the time of their death. I think there are
but three works of art which are inscribed positively with
the words “such a one executed this;” of these I shall give
an account in the proper place. In these cases it appears,
that the artist felt the most perfect satisfaction with his work,
and hence these pieces have excited the envy of every one.</p>

<p>I, indeed, freely admit, that much may be added to my
works; not only to this, but to all which I have published.
By this admission I hope to escape from the carping critics<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>,
and I have the more reason to say this, because I hear
that there are certain Stoics and Logicians<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a>, and also Epicureans
(from the Grammarians<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> I expected as much), who
are big with something against the little work I published
on Grammar<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a>; and that they have been carrying these
abortions for ten years together—a longer pregnancy this
than the elephant’s<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a>. But I well know, that even a woman
once wrote against Theophrastus, a man so eminent for his
eloquence that he obtained his name, which signifies the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Divine speaker<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a>, and that from this circumstance originated
the proverb of choosing a tree to hang oneself<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain from quoting the words of Cato the censor,
which are so pertinent to this point. It appears from them,
that even Cato, who wrote commentaries on military discipline<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a>,
and who had learned the military art under Africanus,
or rather under Hannibal (for he could not endure Africanus<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>,
who, when he was his general, had borne away the
triumph from him), that Cato, I say, was open to the attacks
of such as caught at reputation for themselves by detracting
from the merits of others. And what does he say in his
book? “I know, that when I shall publish what I have written,
there will be many who will do all they can to depreciate
it, and, especially, such as are themselves void of
all merit; but I let their harangues glide by me.” Nor was
the remark of Plancus<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> a bad one, when Asinius Pollio<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> was
said to be preparing an oration against him, which was to
be published either by himself or his children, after the
death of Plancus, in order that he might not be able to
answer it: “It is only ghosts that fight with the dead.”
This gave such a blow to the oration, that in the opinion of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
the learned generally, nothing was ever thought more scandalous.
Feeling myself, therefore, secure against these vile
slanderers<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a>, a name elegantly composed by Cato, to express
their slanderous and vile disposition (for what other object
have they, but to wrangle and breed quarrels?), I will proceed
with my projected work.</p>

<p>And because the public good requires that you should be
spared as much as possible from all trouble, I have subjoined
to this epistle the contents of each of the following books<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>,
and have used my best endeavours to prevent your being
obliged to read them all through. And this, which was
done for your benefit, will also serve the same purpose for
others, so that any one may search for what he wishes, and
may know where to find it. This has been already done
among us by Valerius Soranus, in his work which he entitled
“On Mysteries<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a>.”</p>

<p>The 1st book is the Preface of the Work, dedicated to
Titus Vespasian Cæsar.</p>

Bodies<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>.</p>

<p>The 3rd, 4th, 5th and 6th books are on Geography, in
which is contained an account of the situation of the
different countries, the inhabitants, the seas, towns,
harbours, mountains, rivers, and dimensions, and the
various tribes, some of which still exist and others have
disappeared.</p>

<p>The 7th is on Man, and the Inventions of Man.</p>

itself; it is the work of nature, and itself constitutes
nature<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a>.</p>

<p>It is madness to harass the mind, as some have done, with
attempts to measure the world, and to publish these attempts;
or, like others, to argue from what they have made out,
that there are innumerable other worlds, and that we must
believe there to be so many other natures, or that, if only
one nature produced the whole, there will be so many suns
and so many moons, and that each of them will have immense
trains of other heavenly bodies. As if the same question
would not recur at every step of our inquiry, anxious as we
must be to arrive at some termination; or, as if this infinity,
which we ascribe to nature, the former of all things, cannot
be more easily comprehended by one single formation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
especially when that is so extensive. It is madness, perfect
madness, to go out of this world and to search for what is
beyond it, as if one who is ignorant of his own dimensions
could ascertain the measure of any thing else, or as if the
human mind could see what the world itself cannot contain.</p>

<p>That it has the form of a perfect globe we learn from
the name which has been uniformly given to it, as well as
from numerous natural arguments. For not only does a
figure of this kind return everywhere into itself<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> and sustain
itself, also including itself, requiring no adjustments, not
sensible of either end or beginning in any of its parts, and is
best fitted for that motion, with which, as will appear hereafter,
it is continually turning round; but still more, because
we perceive it, by the evidence of the sight, to be, in every
part, convex and central, which could not be the case were
it of any other figure.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_3">CHAP. 3. (3.)—OF ITS NATURE; WHENCE THE NAME IS DERIVED.</h3></div>

<p>The rising and the setting of the sun clearly prove,
that this globe is carried round in the space of twenty-four
hours, in an eternal and never-ceasing circuit, and with incredible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
swiftness<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a>. I am not able to say, whether the sound
caused by the whirling about of so great a mass be excessive,
and, therefore, far beyond what our ears can perceive, nor,
indeed, whether the resounding of so many stars, all carried
along at the same time and revolving in their orbits, may
not produce a kind of delightful harmony of incredible sweetness<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a>.
To us, who are in the interior, the world appears to
glide silently along, both by day and by night.</p>

<p>Various circumstances in nature prove to us, that there
are impressed on the heavens innumerable figures of animals
and of all kinds of objects, and that its surface is not perfectly
polished like the eggs of birds, as some celebrated
authors assert<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a>. For we find that the seeds of all bodies fall
down from it, principally into the ocean, and, being mixed
together, that a variety of monstrous forms are in this way
frequently produced. And, indeed, this is evident to the eye;
for, in one part, we have the figure of a wain, in another of
a bear, of a bull, and of a letter<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a>; while, in the middle of them,
over our heads, there is a white circle<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a>.</p>

<p>(4.) With respect to the name, I am influenced by the
unanimous opinions of all nations. For what the Greeks,
from its being ornamented, have termed <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</span>, we, from its
perfect and complete elegance, have termed <em>mundus</em>. The
name <em>cœlum</em>, no doubt, refers to its being engraven, as it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
were, with the stars, as Varro suggests<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a>. In confirmation of
this idea we may adduce the Zodiac<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>, in which are twelve
figures of animals; through them it is that the sun has continued
its course for so many ages.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_4">CHAP. 4. (5.)—OF THE ELEMENTS<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> AND THE PLANETS<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a>.</h3></div>

<p>I do not find that any one has doubted that there are
four elements. The highest of these is supposed to be fire,
and hence proceed the eyes of so many glittering stars. The
next is that spirit, which both the Greeks and ourselves call
by the same name, air<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>. It is by the force of this vital principle,
pervading all things and mingling with all, that the
earth, together with the fourth element, water, is balanced in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
the middle of space. These are mutually bound together, the
lighter being restrained by the heavier, so that they cannot
fly off; while, on the contrary, from the lighter tending upwards,
the heavier are so suspended, that they cannot fall
down. Thus, by an equal tendency in an opposite direction,
each of them remains in its appropriate place, bound together
by the never-ceasing revolution of the world, which always
turning on itself, the earth falls to the lowest part and is in
the middle of the whole, while it remains suspended in the
centre<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a>, and, as it were, balancing this centre, in which it is
suspended. So that it alone remains immoveable, whilst all
things revolve round it, being connected with every other
part, whilst they all rest upon it.</p>

<p>(6.) Between this body and the heavens there are suspended,
in this aërial spirit, seven stars<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>, separated by determinate
spaces, which, on account of their motion, we call wandering,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
although, in reality, none are less so<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>. The sun is carried
along in the midst of these, a body of great size and power,
the ruler, not only of the seasons and of the different climates,
but also of the stars themselves and of the heavens<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a>. When
we consider his operations, we must regard him as the life,
or rather the mind of the universe, the chief regulator and
the God of nature; he also lends his light to the other stars<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a>.
He is most illustrious and excellent, beholding all things
and hearing all things, which, I perceive, is ascribed to him
exclusively by the prince of poets, Homer<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_5">CHAP. 5. (7.)—OF GOD<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>.</h3></div>

<p>I consider it, therefore, an indication of human weakness
to inquire into the figure and form of God. For whatever
God be, if there be any other God<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a>, and wherever he exists,
he is all sense, all sight, all hearing, all life, all mind<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>,
and all within himself. To believe that there are a number
of Gods, derived from the virtues and vices of man<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>, as
Chastity, Concord, Understanding, Hope, Honour, Clemency,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and Fidelity; or, according to the opinion of Democritus,
that there are only two, Punishment and Reward<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a>, indicates
still greater folly. Human nature, weak and frail as it is,
mindful of its own infirmity, has made these divisions, so
that every one might have recourse to that which he supposed
himself to stand more particularly in need of<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>. Hence we
find different names employed by different nations; the
inferior deities are arranged in classes, and diseases and
plagues are deified, in consequence of our anxious wish to
propitiate them. It was from this cause that a temple was
dedicated to Fever, at the public expense, on the Palatine
Hill<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>, and to Orbona<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a>, near the Temple of the Lares, and
that an altar was elected to Good Fortune on the Esquiline.
Hence we may understand how it comes to pass that there
is a greater population of the Celestials than of human beings,
since each individual makes a separate God for himself,
adopting his own Juno and his own Genius<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a>. And there
are nations who make Gods of certain animals, and even
certain obscene things<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a>, which are not to be spoken of,
swearing by stinking meats and such like. To suppose
that marriages are contracted between the Gods, and that,
during so long a period, there should have been no issue<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
from them, that some of them should be old and always grey-headed
and others young and like children, some of a dark,
complexion, winged, lame, produced from eggs, living and
dying on alternate days, is sufficiently puerile and foolish.
But it is the height of impudence to imagine, that adultery
takes place between them, that they have contests and
quarrels, and that there are Gods of theft and of various
crimes<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>. To assist man is to be a God; this is the path to
eternal glory. This is the path which the Roman nobles
formerly pursued, and this is the path which is now pursued
by the greatest ruler of our age, Vespasian Augustus, he
who has come to the relief of an exhausted empire, as well
as by his sons. This was the ancient mode of remunerating
those who deserved it, to regard them as Gods<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>. For the
names of all the Gods, as well as of the stars that I have
mentioned above<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a>, have been derived from their services to
mankind. And with respect to Jupiter and Mercury, and
the rest of the celestial nomenclature, who does not admit
that they have reference to certain natural phenomena<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>?</p>

<p>But it is ridiculous to suppose, that the great head of all
things, whatever it be, pays any regard to human affairs<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Can we believe, or rather can there be any doubt, that it is
not polluted by such a disagreeable and complicated office?
It is not easy to determine which opinion would be most
for the advantage of mankind, since we observe some who
have no respect for the Gods, and others who carry it to a
scandalous excess. They are slaves to foreign ceremonies;
they carry on their fingers the Gods and the monsters whom
they worship<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a>; they condemn and they lay great stress on
certain kinds of food; they impose on themselves dreadful
ordinances, not even sleeping quietly. They do not marry
or adopt children, or indeed do anything else, without the
sanction of their sacred rites. There are others, on the contrary,
who will cheat in the very Capitol, and will forswear
themselves even by Jupiter Tonans<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>, and while these thrive
in their crimes, the others torment themselves with their
superstitions to no purpose.</p>

<p>Among these discordant opinions mankind have discovered
for themselves a kind of intermediate deity, by which our
scepticism concerning God is still increased. For all over
the world, in all places, and at all times, Fortune is the only
god whom every one invokes; she alone is spoken of, she
alone is accused and is supposed to be guilty; she alone is
in our thoughts, is praised and blamed, and is loaded with
reproaches; wavering as she is, conceived by the generality
of mankind to be blind, wandering, inconstant, uncertain,
variable, and often favouring the unworthy. To her are referred
all our losses and all our gains, and in casting up the
accounts of mortals she alone balances the two pages of our
sheet<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a>. We are so much in the power of chance, that chance
itself is considered as a God, and the existence of God becomes
doubtful.</p>

<p>But there are others who reject this principle and assign
events to the influence of the stars<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a>, and to the laws of our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
nativity; they suppose that God, once for all, issues his
decrees and never afterwards interferes. This opinion begins
to gain ground, and both the learned and the unlearned
vulgar are falling into it. Hence we have the admonitions
of thunder, the warnings of oracles, the predictions of soothsayers,
and things too trifling to be mentioned, as sneezing
and stumbling with the feet reckoned among omens<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>. The
late Emperor Augustus<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> relates, that he put the left shoe on
the wrong foot, the day when he was near being assaulted
by his soldiers<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>. And such things as these so embarrass
improvident mortals, that among all of them this alone is
certain, that there is nothing certain, and that there is nothing
more proud or more wretched than man. For other
animals have no care but to provide for their subsistence,
for which the spontaneous kindness of nature is all-sufficient;
and this one circumstance renders their lot more
especially preferable, that they never think about glory, or
money, or ambition, and, above all, that they never reflect
on death.</p>

<p>The belief, however, that on these points the Gods superintend
human affairs is useful to us, as well as that the
punishment of crimes, although sometimes tardy, from the
Deity being occupied with such a mass of business, is never
entirely remitted, and that the human race was not made
the next in rank to himself, in order that they might be degraded
like brutes. And indeed this constitutes the great
comfort in this imperfect state of man, that even the Deity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
cannot do everything. For he cannot procure death for
himself, even if he wished it, which, so numerous are the
evils of life, has been granted to man as our chief good. Nor
can he make mortals immortal, or recall to life those who
are dead; nor can he effect, that he who has once lived shall
not have lived, or that he who has enjoyed honours shall not
have enjoyed them; nor has he any influence over past
events but to cause them to be forgotten. And, if we illustrate
the nature of our connexion with God by a less serious
argument, he cannot make twice ten not to be twenty, and
many other things of this kind. By these considerations the
power of Nature is clearly proved, and is shown to be what
we call God. It is not foreign to the subject to have digressed
into these matters, familiar as they are to every one,
from the continual discussions that take place respecting
God<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_6">CHAP. 6. (8.)—OF THE NATURE OF THE STARS; OF THE
MOTION OF THE PLANETS.</h3></div>

<p>Let us return from this digression to the other parts
of nature. The stars which are described as fixed in the
heavens<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a>, are not, as the vulgar suppose, attached each of
them to different individuals<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>, the brighter to the rich, those
that are less so to the poor, and the dim to the aged, shining
according to the lot of the individual, and separately assigned
to mortals; for they have neither come into existence, nor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
do they perish in connexion with particular persons, nor
does a falling star indicate that any one is dead. We are
not so closely connected with the heavens as that the shining
of the stars is affected by our death<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a>. When they are supposed
to shoot or fall<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a>, they throw out, by the force of their
fire, as if from an excess of nutriment, the superabundance
of the humour which they have absorbed, as we observe to
take place from the oil in our lamps, when they are burning<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>.
The nature of the celestial bodies is eternal, being interwoven,
as it were, with the world, and, by this union, rendering
it solid; but they exert their most powerful influence
on the earth. This, notwithstanding its subtilty, may be
known by the clearness and the magnitude of the effect, as
we shall point out in the proper place<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a>. The account of the
circles of the heavens will be better understood when we
come to speak of the earth, since they have all a reference to
it; except what has been discovered respecting the Zodiac,
which I shall now detail.</p>

<p>Anaximander the Milesian, in the 58th olympiad<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>, is said
to have been the first who understood its obliquity, and thus
opened the road to a correct knowledge of the subject<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
Afterwards Cleostratus made the signs in it, first marking
those of Aries and Sagittarius; Atlas had formed the sphere
long before this time<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>. But now, leaving the further consideration
of this subject, we must treat of the bodies that
are situated between the earth and the heavens<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a>.</p>

<p>It is certain that the star called Saturn is the highest, and
therefore appears the smallest, that he passes through the
largest circuit, and that he is at least thirty years in completing
it<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a>. The course of all the planets, and among others
of the Sun, and the Moon, is in the contrary direction to
that of the heavens<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a>, that is towards the left, while the heavens<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
are rapidly carried about to the right<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>. And although,
by the stars constantly revolving with immense velocity,
they are raised up, and hurried on to the part where they
set, yet they are all forced, by a motion of their own, in an
opposite direction<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>; and this is so ordered, lest the air, being
always moved in the same direction, by the constant whirling
of the heavens, should accumulate into one mass, whereas
now it is divided and separated and beaten into small pieces,
by the opposite motion of the different stars. Saturn is a
star of a cold and rigid nature, while the orbit of Jupiter is
much lower, and is carried round in twelve years<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a>. The next
star, Mars, which some persons call Hercules<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>, is of a fiery
and burning nature, and from its nearness to the sun is carried
round in little less than two years<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a>. In consequence of
the excessive heat of this star and the rigidity of Saturn,
Jupiter, which is interposed between the two, is tempered
by both of them, and is thus rendered salutary. The path
of the Sun consists of 360 degrees; but, in order that the
shadow may return to the same point of the dial<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>, we are
obliged to add, in each year, five days and the fourth part of
a day. On this account an intercalary day is given to every
fifth year<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>, that the period of the seasons may agree with
that of the Sun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span></p>

<p>Below the Sun<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> revolves the great star called Venus, wandering
with an alternate motion<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>, and, even in its surnames,
rivalling the Sun and the Moon. For when it precedes the
day and rises in the morning, it receives the name of Lucifer,
as if it were another sun, hastening on the day. On the
contrary, when it shines in the west, it is named Vesper, as
prolonging the light, and performing the office of the moon.
Pythagoras, the Samian, was the first who discovered its
nature<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a>, about the 62nd olympiad, in the 222nd year of the
City<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a>. It excels all the other stars in size, and its brilliancy
is so considerable, that it is the only star which produces a
shadow by its rays. There has, consequently, been great
interest made for its name; some have called it the star of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
Juno<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a>, others of Isis, and others of the Mother of the Gods.
By its influence everything in the earth is generated. For,
as it rises in either direction, it sprinkles everything with
its genial dew, and not only matures the productions of the
earth, but stimulates all living things<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>. It completes the
circuit of the zodiac in 348 days, never receding from the
sun more than 46 degrees, according to Timæus<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>.</p>

<p>Similarly circumstanced, but by no means equal in size
and in power, next to it, is the star Mercury, by some called
Apollo<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a>; it is carried in a lower orbit, and moves in a course
which is quicker by nine days, shining sometimes before the
rising of the sun, and at other times after its setting, but
never going farther from it than 23 degrees<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>, as we learn
from Timæus and Sosigenes<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>. The nature of these two stars
is peculiar, and is not the same with those mentioned above,
for those are seen to recede from the sun through one-third
or one-fourth part of the heavens, and are often seen opposite
to it. They have also other larger circuits, in which they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
make their complete revolutions, as will be described in the
account of the great year<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a>.</p>

<p>(9.) But the Moon<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>, which is the last of the stars, and the
one the most connected with the earth, the remedy provided
by nature for darkness, excels all the others in its admirable
qualities. By the variety of appearances which it assumes, it
puzzles the observers, mortified that they should be the most
ignorant concerning that star which is the nearest to them.
She is always either waxing or waning; sometimes her disc
is curved into horns, sometimes it is divided into two equal
portions, and at other times it is swelled out into a full orb;
sometimes she appears spotted<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> and suddenly becomes very
bright; she appears very large with her full orb and suddenly
becomes invisible; now continuing during all the night,
now rising late, and now aiding the light of the sun during
a part of the day; becoming eclipsed and yet being visible
while she is eclipsed; concealing herself at the end of the
month and yet not supposed to be eclipsed<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>. Sometimes
she is low down, sometimes she is high up, and that not according
to one uniform course, being at one time raised up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
to the heavens, at other times almost contiguous to the
mountains; now elevated in the north, now depressed in the
south; all which circumstances having been noticed by Endymion,
a report was spread about, that he was in love with
the moon<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>. We are not indeed sufficiently grateful to those,
who, with so much labour and care, have enlightened us with
this light<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a>; while, so diseased is the human mind, that we
take pleasure in writing the annals of blood and slaughter,
in order that the crimes of men may be made known to those
who are ignorant of the constitution of the world itself.</p>

<p>Being nearest to the axis<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>, and therefore having the smallest
orbit, the Moon passes in twenty-seven days and the one-third
part of a day<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>, through the same space for which Saturn,
the highest of the planets, as was stated above, requires thirty
years. After remaining for two days in conjunction with the
sun, on the thirtieth day she again very slowly emerges to pursue
her accustomed course<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a>. I know not whether she ought
not to be considered as our instructress in everything that can
be known respecting the heavens; as that the year is divided
into the twelve divisions of the months, since she follows the
sun for the same number of times, until he returns to the
commencement of his course; and that her brightness, as
well as that of the other stars, is regulated by that of the
sun, if indeed they all of them shine by light borrowed from
him, such as we see floating about, when it is reflected from
the surface of water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
On this account it is that she dissolves
so much moisture, by a gentle and less perfect force, and
adds to the quantity of that which the rays of the sun consume<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a>.
On this account she appears with an unequal light,
because being full only when she is in opposition, on all the
remaining days she shows only so much of herself to the
earth as she receives light from the sun<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>. She is not seen
in conjunction, because, at that time, she sends back the
whole stream of light to the source whence she has derived
it. That the stars generally are nourished by the terrestrial
moisture is evident, because, when the moon is only half visible
she is sometimes seen spotted, her power of absorbing
moisture not having been powerful enough; for the spots
are nothing else than the dregs of the earth drawn up along
with the moisture<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>. (10.) But her eclipses and those of the
sun, the most wonderful of all the phenomena of nature, and
which are like prodigies, serve to indicate the magnitude of
these bodies and the shadow<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> which they cast.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_7">CHAP. 7.—OF THE ECLIPSES OF THE MOON AND THE SUN.</h3></div>

<p>For it is evident that the sun is hid by the intervention<a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>
of the moon, and the moon by the opposition<a href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> of the earth,
and that these changes are mutual, the moon, by her interposition<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>,
taking the rays of the sun from the earth, and the
earth from the moon. As she advances darkness is suddenly
produced, and again the sun is obscured by her shade; for
night is nothing more than the shade of the earth. The
figure of this shade is like that of a pyramid or an inverted
top<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a>; and the moon enters it only near its point, and it does
not exceed the height of the moon, for there is no other star
which is obscured in the same manner, while a figure of this
kind always terminates in a point. The flight of birds, when
very lofty, shows that shadows do not extend beyond a certain
distance; their limit appears to be the termination of the
air and the commencement of the æther. Above the moon
everything is pure and full of an eternal light. The stars
are visible to us in the night, in the same way that other
luminous bodies are seen in the dark. It is from these causes
that the moon is eclipsed during the night<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a>. The two kinds
of eclipses are not, however, at the stated monthly periods,
on account of the obliquity of the zodiac, and the irregularly
wandering course of the moon, as stated above; besides that
the motions of these stars do not always occur exactly at the
same points<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_8">CHAP. 8. (11.)—OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE STARS.</h3></div>

<p>This kind of reasoning carries the human mind to the
heavens, and by contemplating the world as it were from
thence, it discloses to us the magnitude of the three greatest
bodies in nature<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a>. For the sun could not be entirely concealed
from the earth, by the intervention of the moon, if the
earth were greater than the moon<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a>. And the vast size of
the third body, the sun, is manifest from that of the other
two, so that it is not necessary to scrutinize its size, by arguing
from its visible appearance, or from any conjectures of
the mind; it must be immense, because the shadows of rows
of trees, extending for any number of miles, are disposed in
right lines<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a>, as if the sun were in the middle of space. Also,
because, at the equinox, he is vertical to all the inhabitants
of the southern districts at the same time<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a>; also, because
the shadows of all the people who live on this side of the
tropic fall, at noon, towards the north, and, at sunrise, point
to the west. But this could not be the case unless the sun
were much greater than the earth; nor, unless it much exceeded
Mount Ida in breadth, could he be seen when he
rises, passing considerably beyond it to the right and to the
left, especially, considering that it is separated by so great
an interval<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span></p>

<p>The eclipse of the moon affords an undoubted argument
of the sun’s magnitude, as it also does of the small size of
the earth<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>. For there are shadows of three figures, and it is
evident, that if the body which produces the shadow be equal
to the light, then it will be thrown off in the form of a pillar,
and have no termination. If the body be greater than the
light, the shadow will be in the form of an inverted cone<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a>
the bottom being the narrowest part, and being, at the same
time, of an infinite length. If the body be less than the
light, then we shall have the figure of a pyramid<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a>, terminating
in a point. Now of this last kind is the shadow which
produces the eclipse of the moon, and this is so manifest that
there can be no doubt remaining, that the earth is exceeded
in magnitude by the sun, a circumstance which is indeed indicated
by the silent declaration of nature herself. For why
does he recede from us at the winter half of the year<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a>? That
by the darkness of the nights the earth may be refreshed,
which otherwise would be burned up, as indeed it is in certain
parts; so great is his size.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_9">CHAP. 9. (12.)—AN ACCOUNT OF THE OBSERVATIONS THAT
HAVE BEEN MADE ON THE HEAVENS BY DIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.</h3></div>

<p>The first among the Romans, who explained to the people
at large the cause of the two kinds of eclipses, was Sulpicius
Gallus, who was consul along with Marcellus; and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
when he was only a military tribune he relieved the army
from great anxiety the day before king Perseus was conquered
by Paulus<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a>; for he was brought by the general into
a public assembly, in order to predict the eclipse, of which
he afterwards gave an account in a separate treatise. Among
the Greeks, Thales the Milesian first investigated the subject,
in the fourth year of the forty-eighth olympiad, predicting
the eclipse of the sun which took place in the reign
of Alyattes, in the 170th year of the City<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>. After them Hipparchus
calculated the course of both these stars for the term
of 600 years<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a>, including the months, days, and hours, the
situation of the different places and the aspects adapted to
each of them; all this has been confirmed by experience,
and could only be acquired by partaking, as it were, in the
councils of nature. These were indeed great men, superior
to ordinary mortals, who having discovered the laws of these
divine bodies, relieved the miserable mind of man from the
fear which he had of eclipses, as foretelling some dreadful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
events or the destruction of the stars. This alarm is freely
acknowledged in the sublime strains of Stesichorus and Pindar,
as being produced by an eclipse of the sun<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a>. And with
respect to the eclipse of the moon, mortals impute it to
witchcraft, and therefore endeavour to aid her by producing
discordant sounds. In consequence of this kind of terror it
was that Nicias, the general of the Athenians, being ignorant
of the cause, was afraid to lead out the fleet, and brought
great distress on his troops<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a>. Hail to your genius, ye interpreters
of heaven! ye who comprehend the nature of
things, and who have discovered a mode of reasoning by
which ye have conquered both gods and men<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a>! For who is
there, in observing these things and seeing the labours<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a>
which the stars are compelled to undergo (since we have
chosen to apply this term to them), that would not cheerfully
submit to his fate, as one born to die? I shall now,
in a brief and summary manner, touch on those points in
which we are agreed, giving the reasons where it is necessary
to do so; for this is not a work of profound argument, nor
is it less wonderful to be able to suggest a probable cause for
everything, than to give a complete account of a few of
them only.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_10">CHAP. 10. (13.)—ON THE RECURRENCE OF THE ECLIPSES OF
THE SUN AND THE MOON.</h3></div>

<p>It is ascertained that the eclipses complete their whole
revolution in the space of 223 months<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a>, that the eclipse
of the sun takes place only at the conclusion or the commencement
of a lunation, which is termed conjunction<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
while an eclipse of the moon takes place only when she is
at the full, and is always a little farther advanced than the
preceding eclipse<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a>. Now there are eclipses of both these
stars in every year, which take place below the earth, at
stated days and hours; and when they are above it<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> they are
not always visible, sometimes on account of the clouds, but
more frequently, from the globe of the earth being opposed
to the vault of the heavens<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a>. It was discovered two hundred
years ago, by the sagacity of Hipparchus, that the moon is
sometimes eclipsed after an interval of five months, and the
sun after an interval of seven<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>; also, that he becomes invisible,
while above the horizon, twice in every thirty days,
but that this is seen in different places at different times.
But the most wonderful circumstance is, that while it is admitted
that the moon is darkened by the shadow of the earth,
this occurs at one time on its western, and at another time
on its eastern side. And farther, that although, after the
rising of the sun, that darkening shadow ought to be below
the earth, yet it has once happened, that the moon has been
eclipsed in the west, while both the luminaries have been above
the horizon<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a>. And as to their both being invisible in the
space of fifteen days, this very thing happened while the
Vespasians were emperors, the father being consul for the
third time, and the son for the second<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_11">CHAP. 11. (14.)—OF THE MOTION OF THE MOON.</h3></div>

<p>It is certain that the moon, having her horns always turned
from the sun, when she is waxing, looks towards the east;
when she is waning, towards the west. Also, that, from the
second day after the change, she adds 47<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> minutes<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> each day,
until she is full, and again decreases at the same rate, and
that she always becomes invisible when she is within 14 degrees
of the sun. This is an argument of the greater size of
the planets than of the moon, since these emerge when they
are at the distance of 7 degrees only<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>. But their altitude
causes them to appear much smaller, as we observe that,
during the day, the brightness of the sun prevents those
bodies from being seen which are fixed in the firmament,
although they shine then as well as in the night: that this
is the case is proved by eclipses, and by descending into very
deep wells.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_12">CHAP. 12. (15.)—OF THE MOTIONS OF THE PLANETS AND
THE GENERAL LAWS OF THEIR ASPECTS<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a>.</h3></div>

<p>The three planets, which, as we have said, are situated
above the sun<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>, are visible when they come into conjunction
with him. They rise visibly<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> in the morning, when they are
not more than 11 degrees from the sun<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a>; they are afterwards
directed by the contact of his rays<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a>, and when they attain
the trine aspect, at the distance of 120 degrees, they take
their morning stationary positions<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a>, which are termed primary;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
afterwards, when they are in opposition to the sun, they
rise at the distance of 180 degrees from him. And again advancing
on the other side to the 120th degree, they attain their
evening stations, which are termed secondary, until the sun
having arrived within 12 degrees of them, what is called their
evening setting becomes no longer visible<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a>. Mars, as being
nearer to the sun, feels the influence of his rays in the quadrature,
at the distance of 90 degrees, whence that motion receives
its name, being termed, from the two risings, respectively the
first and the second nonagenarian<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>. This planet passes from
one station to another in six months, or is two months in each
sign; the two other planets do not spend more than four
months in passing from station to station.</p>

<p>The two inferior planets are, in like manner, concealed in
their evening conjunction, and, when they have left the sun,
they rise in the morning the same number of degrees distant
from him. After having arrived at their point of greatest
elongation<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a>, they then follow the sun, and having overtaken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
him at their morning setting, they become invisible and pass
beyond him. They then rise in the evening, at the distances
which were mentioned above. After this they return back
to the sun and are concealed in their evening setting. The
star Venus becomes stationary when at its two points of
greatest elongation, that of the morning and of the evening,
according to their respective risings. The stationary points
of Mercury are so very brief, that they cannot be correctly
observed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_13">CHAP. 13.—WHY THE SAME STARS APPEAR AT SOME TIMES
MORE LOFTY AND AT OTHER TIMES MORE NEAR.</h3></div>

<p>The above is an account of the aspects and the occultations
of the planets, a subject which is rendered very complicated
by their motions, and is involved in much that is wonderful;
especially, when we observe that they change their size and
colour, and that the same stars at one time approach the
north, and then go to the south, and are now seen near the
earth, and then suddenly approach the heavens. If on this
subject I deliver opinions different from my predecessors, I
acknowledge that I am indebted for them to those individuals
who first pointed out to us the proper mode of inquiry;
let no one then ever despair of benefiting future ages.</p>

<p>But these things depend upon many different causes. The
first cause is the nature of the circles described by the stars,
which the Greeks term <em>apsides</em><a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a>, for we are obliged to use
Greek terms. Now each of the planets has its own circle,
and this a different one from that of the world<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>; because the
earth is placed in the centre of the heavens, with respect to
the two extremities, which are called the poles, and also in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
that of the zodiac, which is situated obliquely between them.
And all these things are made evident by the infallible results
which we obtain by the use of the compasses<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>. Hence the
apsides of the planets have each of them different centres, and
consequently they have different orbits and motions, since it
necessarily follows, that the interior apsides are the shortest.</p>

<p>(16.) The apsides which are the highest from the centre
of the earth are, for Saturn, when he is in Scorpio, for Jupiter
in Virgo, for Mars in Leo, for the Sun in Gemini, for Venus
in Sagittarius, and for Mercury in Capricorn, each of them
in the middle of these signs; while in the opposite signs,
they are the lowest and nearest to the centre of the earth<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>.
Hence it is that they appear to move more slowly when
they are carried along the highest circuit; not that their
actual motions are accelerated or retarded, these being fixed
and determinate for each of them; but because it necessarily
follows, that lines drawn from the highest apsis must approach
nearer to each other at the centre, like the spokes of a wheel;
and that the same motion seems to be at one time greater,
and at another time less, according to the distance from the
centre.</p>

<p>Another cause of the altitudes of the planets is, that their
highest apsides, with relation to their own centres, are in
different signs from those mentioned above<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a>. Saturn is in
the 20th degree of Libra, Jupiter in the 15th of Cancer,
Mars in the 28th of Capricorn, the Sun in the 19th of Aries,
Venus in the 27th of Pisces, Mercury in the 15th of Virgo,
and the Moon in the 3rd of Taurus.</p>

<p>The third cause of the altitude depends on the form of the
heavens, not on that of the orbits; the stars appearing to
the eye to mount up and to descend through the depth of
the air<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a>. With this cause is connected that which depends<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
on the latitude of the planets and the obliquity of the zodiac.
It is through this belt that the stars which I have spoken of
are carried, nor is there any part of the world habitable, except
what lies under it<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>; the remainder, which is at the poles,
being in a wild desert state. The planet Venus alone exceeds
it by 2 degrees, which we may suppose to be the cause why
some animals are produced even in these desert regions of
the earth. The moon also wanders the whole breadth of the
zodiac, but never exceeds it. Next to these the planet Mercury
moves through the greatest space; yet out of the 12 degrees
(for there are so many degrees of latitude in the zodiac<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a>),
it does not pass through more than 8, nor does it go equally
through these, 2 of them being in the middle of the zodiac,
4 in the upper part, and 2 in the lower part<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a>. Next to these
the Sun is carried through the middle of the zodiac, winding
unequally through the two parts of his tortuous circuit<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>.
The star Mars occupies the four middle degrees; Jupiter
the middle degree and the two above it; Saturn, like the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
sun, occupies two<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a>. The above is an account of the latitudes
as they descend to the south or ascend to the north<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>.
Hence it is plain that the generality of persons are mistaken
in supposing the third cause of the apparent altitude to
depend on the stars rising from the earth and climbing up
the heavens. But to refute this opinion it is necessary to
consider the subject with very great minuteness, and to
embrace all the causes.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted, that the stars<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>, at the time of
their evening setting, are nearest to the earth, both with
respect to latitude and altitude<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a>, that they are at the commencement
of both at their morning risings, and that they
become stationary at the middle points of their latitudes,
what are called the ecliptics<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>. It is, moreover, acknowledged,
that their motion is increased when they are in the
vicinity of the earth, and diminished when they are removed
to a greater altitude<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>; a point which is most clearly proved
by the different altitudes of the moon. There is no doubt
that it is also increased at the morning risings<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a>, and that the
three superior planets are retarded, as they advance from
the first station to the second. And since this is the case, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
is evident, that the latitudes are increased from the time of
their morning risings, since the motions afterwards appear
to receive less addition; but they gain their altitude in the
first station, since the rate of their motion then begins to
diminish<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a>, and the stars to recede.</p>

<p>And the reason of this must be particularly set forth.
When the planets are struck by the rays of the sun, in the
situation which I have described, <em>i. e.</em> in their quadrature,
they are prevented from holding on their straight forward
course, and are raised on high by the force of the fire<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>. This
cannot be immediately perceived by the eye, and therefore
they seem to be stationary, and hence the term station is
derived. Afterwards the violence of the rays increases, and
the vapour being beaten back forces them to recede.</p>

<p>This exists in a greater degree in their evening risings, the
sun being then turned entirely from them, when they are
drawn into the highest apsides; and they are then the least
visible, since they are at their greatest altitude and are
carried along with the least motion, as much less indeed as
this takes place in the highest signs of the apsides. At the
time of the evening rising the latitude decreases and becomes
less as the motion is diminished, and it does not increase
again until they arrive at the second station, when the altitude
is also diminished; the sun’s rays then coming from
the other side, the same force now therefore propels them
towards the earth which before raised them into the heavens,
from their former triangular aspect<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a>. So different is the
effect whether the rays strike the planets from below or
come to them from above. And all these circumstances
produce much more effect when they occur in the evening
setting. This is the doctrine of the superior planets; that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
of the others is more difficult, and has never been laid down
by any one before me<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_14">CHAP. 14. (17.)—WHY THE SAME STARS HAVE DIFFERENT
MOTIONS.</h3></div>

<p>I must first state the cause, why the star Venus never
recedes from the sun more than 46 degrees, nor Mercury more
than 23<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a>, while they frequently return to the sun within this
distance<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a>. As they are situated below the sun, they have
both of them their apsides turned in the contrary direction;
their orbits are as much below the earth as those of the
stars above mentioned are above it, and therefore they cannot
recede any farther, since the curve of their apsides has no
greater longitude<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a>. The extreme parts of their apsides
therefore assign the limits to each of them in the same
manner, and compensate, as it were, for the small extent of
their longitudes, by the great divergence of their latitudes<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a>.
It may be asked, why do they not always proceed as far as
the 46th and the 23rd degrees respectively? They in reality
do so, but the theory fails us here. For it would appear
that the apsides are themselves moved, as they never pass
over the sun<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a>. When therefore they have arrived at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
extremities of their orbits on either side, the stars are then
supposed to have proceeded to their greatest distance; when
they have been a certain number of degrees within their
orbits, they are then supposed to return more rapidly, since
the extreme point in each is the same. And on this account
it is that the direction of their motion appears to be changed.
For the superior planets are carried along the most quickly
in their evening setting, while these move the most slowly;
the former are at their greatest distance from the earth
when they move the most slowly, the latter when they move
the most quickly. The former are accelerated when nearest
to the earth, the latter when at the extremity of the circle;
in the former the rapidity of the motion begins to
diminish at their morning risings, in the latter it begins to
increase; the former are retrograde from their morning to
their evening station, while Venus is retrograde from the
evening to the morning station. She begins to increase her
latitude from her morning rising, her altitude follows the
sun from her morning station, her motion being the quickest
and her altitude the greatest in her morning setting. Her
latitude decreases and her altitude diminishes from her
evening rising, she becomes retrograde, and at the same
time decreases in her altitude from her evening station.</p>

<p>Again, the star Mercury, in the same way, mounts up in
both directions<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> from his morning rising, and having followed
the sun through a space of 15 degrees, he becomes almost stationary
for four days. Presently he diminishes his altitude,
and recedes from his evening setting to his morning rising.
Mercury and the Moon are the only planets which descend
for the same number of days that they ascend. Venus
ascends for fifteen days and somewhat more; Saturn and
Jupiter descend in twice that number of days, and Mars in
four times. So great is the variety of nature! The reason
of it is, however, evident; for those planets which are forced
up by the vapour of the sun likewise descend with difficulty.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_15">CHAP. 15.—GENERAL LAWS<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> OF THE PLANETS.</h3></div>

<p>There are many other secrets of nature in these points, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
well as the laws to which they are subject, which might be
mentioned. For example, the planet Mars, whose course is
the most difficult to observe<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a>, never becomes stationary when
Jupiter is in the trine aspect, very rarely when he is 60 degrees
from the sun, which number is one-sixth of the circuit of the
heavens<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a>; nor does he ever rise in the same sign with Jupiter,
except in Cancer and Leo. The star Mercury seldom has
his evening risings in Pisces, but very frequently in Virgo,
and his morning risings in Libra; he has also his morning
rising in Aquarius, very rarely in Leo. He never becomes
retrograde either in Taurus or in Gemini, nor until the 25th
degree of Cancer. The Moon makes her double conjunction
with the sun in no other sign except Gemini, while Sagittarius
is the only sign in which she has sometimes no conjunction
at all. The old and the new moon are visible on
the same day or night in no other sign except Aries, and
indeed it has happened very seldom to any one to have witnessed
it. Prom this circumstance it was that the tale of
Lynceus’s quick-sightedness originated<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a>. Saturn and Mars
are invisible at most for 170 days; Jupiter for 36, or, at the
least, for 10 days less than this; Venus for 69, or, at the least,
for 52; Mercury for 13, or, at the most, for 18<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_16">CHAP. 16. (18.)—THE REASON WHY THE STARS ARE OF DIFFERENT
COLOURS.</h3></div>

<p>The difference of their colour depends on the difference in
their altitudes; for they acquire a resemblance to those planets
into the vapour of which they are carried, the orbit of each
tinging those that approach it in each direction. A colder
planet renders one that approaches it paler, one more hot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
renders it redder, a windy planet gives it a lowering aspect,
while the sun, at the union of their apsides, or the extremity
of their orbits, completely obscures them. Each of the
planets has its peculiar colour<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>; Saturn is white, Jupiter
brilliant, Mars fiery, Lucifer is glowing, Vesper refulgent,
Mercury sparkling, the Moon mild; the Sun, when he rises,
is blazing, afterwards he becomes radiating. The appearance
of the stars, which are fixed in the firmament, is also affected
by these causes. At one time we see a dense cluster of stars
around the moon, when she is only half-enlightened, and
when they are viewed in a serene evening; while, at another
time, when the moon is full, there are so few to be seen, that
we wonder whither they are fled; and this is also the case when
the rays of the sun, or of any of the above-mentioned bodies<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>,
have dazzled our sight. And, indeed, the moon herself is,
without doubt, differently affected at different times by the
rays of the sun; when she is entering them, the convexity
of the heavens<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> rendering them more feeble than when they
fall upon her more directly<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a>. Hence, when she is at a right
angle to the sun, she is half-enlightened; when in the trine
aspect, she presents an imperfect orb<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a>, while, in opposition,
she is full. Again, when she is waning, she goes through
the same gradations, and in the same order, as the three stars
that are superior to the sun<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_17">CHAP. 17. (19.)—OF THE MOTION OF THE SUN AND THE CAUSE
OF THE IRREGULARITY OF THE DAYS.</h3></div>

<p>The Sun himself is in four different states; twice the night<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
is equal to the day, in the Spring and in the Autumn,
when he is opposed to the centre of the earth<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a>, in the 8th
degree of Aries and Libra<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a>. The length of the day and the
night is then twice changed, when the day increases in length,
from the winter solstice in the 8th degree of Capricorn, and
afterwards, when the night increases in length from the
summer solstice in the 8th degree of Cancer<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>. The cause of
this inequality is the obliquity of the zodiac, since there is,
at every moment of time, an equal portion of the firmament
above and below the horizon. But the signs which mount
directly upwards, when they rise, retain the light for a longer
space, while those that are more oblique pass along more
quickly.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_18">CHAP. 18. (20.)—WHY THUNDER IS ASCRIBED TO JUPITER.</h3></div>

<p>It is not generally known, what has been discovered by
men who are the most eminent for their learning, in consequence
of their assiduous observations of the heavens, that
the fires which fall upon the earth, and receive the name of
thunder-bolts, proceed from the three superior stars<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a>, but
principally from the one which is situated in the middle. It
may perhaps depend on the superabundance of moisture from
the superior orbit communicating with the heat from the
inferior, which are expelled in this manner<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a>; and hence it
is commonly said, the thunder-bolts are darted by Jupiter.
And as, in burning wood, the burnt part is cast off with a
crackling noise, so does the star throw off this celestial fire,
bearing the omens of future events, even the part which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
thrown off not losing its divine operation. And this takes
place more particularly when the air is in an unsettled state,
either because the moisture which is then collected excites
the greatest quantity of fire, or because the air is disturbed,
as if by the parturition of the pregnant star.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_19">CHAP. 19. (21.)—OF THE DISTANCES OF THE STARS.</h3></div>

<p>Many persons have attempted to discover the distance of
the stars from the earth, and they have published as the
result, that the sun is nineteen times as far from the moon,
as the moon herself is from the earth<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a>. Pythagoras, who
was a man of a very sagacious mind, computed the distance
from the earth to the moon to be 126,000 furlongs, that
from her to the sun is double this distance, and that it is
three times this distance to the twelve signs<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a>; and this was
also the opinion of our countryman, Gallus Sulpicius<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_20">CHAP. 20. (22.)—OF THE HARMONY OF THE STARS.</h3></div>

<p>Pythagoras, employing the terms that are used in music,
sometimes names the distance between the Earth and the
Moon a tone; from her to Mercury he supposes to be half
this space, and about the same from him to Venus. From
her to the Sun is a tone and a half; from the Sun to Mars is
a tone, the same as from the Earth to the Moon; from him
there is half a tone to Jupiter, from Jupiter to Saturn also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
half a tone, and thence a tone and a half to the zodiac.
Hence there are seven tones, which he terms the diapason
harmony<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>, meaning the whole compass of the notes. In
this, Saturn is said to move in the Doric time, Jupiter in the
Phrygian<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a>, and so forth of the rest; but this is a refinement
rather amusing than useful.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_21">CHAP. 21. (23.)—OF THE DIMENSIONS OF THE WORLD.</h3></div>

<p>The stadium is equal to 125 of our Roman paces, or 625 feet<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>.
Posidonius<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> supposes that there is a space of not less than
40 stadia around the earth, whence mists<a href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>, winds and clouds<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a>
proceed; beyond this he supposes that the air is pure and
liquid, consisting of uninterrupted light; from the clouded
region to the moon there is a space of 2,000,000 of stadia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
and thence to the sun of 500,000,000<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>. It is in consequence
of this space that the sun, notwithstanding his immense
magnitude, does not burn the earth. Many persons have
imagined that the clouds rise to the height of 900 stadia.
These points are not completely made out, and are difficult
to explain; but we have given the best account of them that
has been published, and if we may be allowed, in any degree,
to pursue these investigations, there is one infallible geometrical
principle, which we cannot reject. Not that we can
ascertain the exact dimensions (for to profess to do this
would be almost the act of a madman), but that the mind
may have some estimate to direct its conjectures. Now it is
evident that the orbit through which the sun passes consists
of nearly 366 degrees, and that the diameter is always the third
part and a little less than the seventh of the circumference<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a>.
Then taking the half of this (for the earth is placed in the
centre) it will follow, that nearly one-sixth part of the immense
space, which the mind conceives as constituting the
orbit of the sun round the earth, will compose his altitude.
That of the moon will be one-twelfth part, since her course
is so much shorter than that of the sun; she is therefore
carried along midway between the sun and the earth<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a>. It
is astonishing to what an extent the weakness of the mind
will proceed, urged on by a little success, as in the above-mentioned
instance, to give full scope to its impudence!
Thus, having ventured to guess at the space between the sun
and the earth, we do the same with respect to the heavens,
because he is situated midway between them; so that we may
come to know the measure of the whole world in inches.
For if the diameter consist of seven parts, there will be
twenty-two of the same parts in the circumference; as if we
could measure the heavens by a plumb-line!</p>

<p>The Egyptian calculation, which was made out by Petosiris<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
and Necepsos, supposes that each degree of the lunar
orbit (which, as I have said, is the least) consists of little
more than 33 stadia; in the very large orbit of Saturn the
number is double; in that of the sun, which, as we have
said, is in the middle<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>, we have the half of the sum of these
numbers. And this is indeed a very modest calculation<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a>,
since if we add to the orbit of Saturn the distance from him
to the zodiac, we shall have an infinite number of degrees<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_22">CHAP. 22. (24.)—OF THE STARS WHICH APPEAR SUDDENLY,
OR OF COMETS<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a>.</h3></div>

<p>A few things still remain to be said concerning the world;
for stars are suddenly formed in the heavens themselves; of
these there are various kinds.</p>

<p>(25.) The Greeks name these stars <em>comets</em><a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a>; we name them
Crinitæ, as if shaggy with bloody locks, and surrounded with
bristles like hair. Those stars, which have a mane hanging
down from their lower part, like a long beard, are named
Pogoniæ<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a>. Those that are named Acontiæ<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> vibrate like a dart
with a very quick motion. It was one of this kind which the
Emperor Titus described in his very excellent poem, as
having been seen in his fifth consulship; and this was the
last of these bodies which has been observed. When they
are short and pointed they are named Xiphiæ<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a>; these are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
pale kind; they shine like a sword and are without any rays;
while we name those Discei<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a>, which, being of an amber colour,
in conformity with their name, emit a few rays from their
margin only. A kind named Pitheus<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> exhibits the figure of
a cask, appearing convex and emitting a smoky light. The
kind named Cerastias<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> has the appearance of a horn; it is
like the one which was visible when the Greeks fought at
Salamis. Lampadias<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> is like a burning torch; Hippias<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> is
like a horse’s mane; it has a very rapid motion, like a circle
revolving on itself. There is also a white comet, with silver
hair, so brilliant that it can scarcely be looked at, exhibiting,
as it were, the aspect of the Deity in a human form. There
are some also that are shaggy, having the appearance of a
fleece, surrounded by a kind of crown. There was one,
where the appearance of a mane was changed into that of a
spear; it happened in the 109th olympiad, in the 398th year
of the City<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a>. The shortest time during which any one of
them has been observed to be visible is 7 days, the longest
180 days.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_23">CHAP. 23.—THEIR NATURE, SITUATION, AND SPECIES.</h3></div>

<p>Some of them move about in the manner of planets<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>, others
remain stationary. They are almost all of them seen towards
the north<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a>, not indeed in any particular portion of it, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
generally in that white part of it which has obtained the
name of the Milky Way. Aristotle informs us that several
of them are to be seen at the same time<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a>, but this, as far as
I know, has not been observed by any one else; also that
they prognosticate high winds and great heat<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a>. They are
also visible in the winter months, and about the south pole,
but they have no rays proceeding from them. There was a
dreadful one observed by the Æthiopians and the Egyptians,
to which Typhon, a king of that period, gave his own name;
it had a fiery appearance, and was twisted like a spiral; its
aspect was hideous, nor was it like a star, but rather like a
knot of fire<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a>. Sometimes there are hairs attached to the
planets and the other stars. Comets are never seen in the
western part of the heavens. It is generally regarded as a
terrific star, and one not easily expiated; as was the case with
the civil commotions in the consulship of Octavius, and also
in the war of Pompey and Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a>. And in our own age,
about the time when Claudius Cæsar was poisoned and
left the Empire to Domitius Nero, and afterwards, while the
latter was Emperor<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a>, there was one which was almost constantly
seen and was very frightful. It is thought important
to notice towards what part it darts its beams, or from what
star it receives its influence, what it resembles, and in what
places it shines. If it resembles a flute, it portends something<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
unfavourable respecting music; if it appears in the
parts of the signs referred to the secret members, something
respecting lewdness of manners; something respecting wit
and learning, if they form a triangular or quadrangular
figure with the position of some of the fixed stars; and that
some one will be poisoned, if they appear in the head of either
the northern or the southern serpent.</p>

<p>Rome is the only place in the whole world where there is
a temple dedicated to a comet; it was thought by the late
Emperor Augustus to be auspicious to him, from its appearing
during the games which he was celebrating in honour of
Venus Genetrix, not long after the death of his father Cæsar,
in the College which was founded by him<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a>. He expressed
his joy in these terms: “During the very time of these games
of mine, a hairy star was seen during seven days, in the part
of the heavens which is under the Great Bear. It rose about
the eleventh hour of the day<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>, was very bright, and was conspicuous
in all parts of the earth. The common people supposed
the star to indicate, that the soul of Cæsar was admitted
among the immortal Gods; under which designation it was
that the star was placed on the bust which was lately consecrated
in the forum<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a>.” This is what he proclaimed in public,
but, in secret, he rejoiced at this auspicious omen, interpreting
it as produced for himself; and, to confess the truth, it really
proved a salutary omen for the world at large<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a>.</p>

<p>Some persons suppose that these stars are permanent, and
that they move through their proper orbits, but that they are
only visible when they recede from the sun. Others suppose
that they are produced by an accidental vapour together
with the force of fire, and that, from this circumstance, they
are liable to be dissipated<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a>.</p>

<p>This same Hipparchus, who can never be sufficiently
commended, as one who more especially proved the relation
of the stars to man, and that our souls are a portion of
heaven, discovered a new star that was produced in his own
age, and, by observing its motions on the day in which it
shone, he was led to doubt whether it does not often happen,
that those stars have motion which we suppose to be fixed.
And the same individual attempted, what might seem presumptuous
even in a deity, viz. to number the stars for
posterity and to express their relations by appropriate names;
having previously devised instruments<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a>, by which he might
mark the places and the magnitudes of each individual star.
In this way it might be easily discovered, not only whether
they were destroyed or produced, but whether they changed
their relative positions, and likewise, whether they were increased
or diminished; the heavens being thus left as an
inheritance to any one, who might be found competent to
complete his plan.</p>

that the evils occurred, not because the prodigies took place,
but that these took place because the evils were appointed
to occur at that period<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a>. Their cause is obscure in consequence
of their rarity, and therefore we are not as well
acquainted with them as we are with the rising of the stars,

things.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_28">CHAP. 28. (28.)—OF CELESTIAL CORONÆ.</h3></div>

<p>Stars are occasionally seen along with the sun, for whole
days together, and generally round its orb, like wreaths made
of the ears of corn, or circles of various colours<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a>; such as
occurred when Augustus, while a very young man, was
entering the city, after the death of his father, in order to
take upon himself the great name which he assumed<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>. (29.)

above or below the real sun, but in an oblique direction, never
near nor opposite to the earth, nor in the night, but either
in the east or in the west. They are said to have been seen
once at noon in the Bosphorus, and to have continued from
morning until sunset. Our ancestors have frequently seen
three suns at the same time<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a>, as was the case in the consulship

one during the reign of the late Emperor Claudius, when he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>

<p>These stars occur both at sea and at land. I have seen,
during the night-watches of the soldiers, a luminous appearance,
like a star, attached to the javelins on the ramparts.
They also settle on the yard-arms and other parts of ships
while sailing, producing a kind of vocal sound, like that of birds
flitting about. When they occur singly they are mischievous,
so as even to sink the vessels, and if they strike on the lower
part of the keel, setting them on fire<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a>. When there are two
of them they are considered auspicious, and are thought to
predict a prosperous voyage, as it is said that they drive
away that dreadful and terrific meteor named Helena. On
this account their efficacy is ascribed to Castor and Pollux,
and they are invoked as gods. They also occasionally shine
round the heads of men in the evening<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a>, which is considered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
as predicting something very important. But there is great
uncertainty respecting the cause of all these things, and they
are concealed in the majesty of nature.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_38">CHAP. 38. (38.)—OF THE AIR AND ON THE CAUSE OF THE
SHOWERS OF STONES.</h3></div>

<p>So far I have spoken of the world itself and of the stars.
I must now give an account of the other remarkable phænomena
of the heavens. For our ancestors have given the
name of heavens, or, sometimes, another name, air, to all the
seemingly void space, which diffuses around us this vital
spirit. It is situated beneath the moon, indeed much lower,
as is admitted by every one who has made observations on
it, and is composed of a great quantity of air from the upper
regions, mixed with a great quantity of terrestrial vapour, the
two forming a compound. Hence proceed clouds, thunder
and lightning of all kinds; hence also hail, frost, showers,
storms and whirlwinds; hence proceed many of the evils
incident to mortals, and the mutual contests of the various
parts of nature. The force of the stars keeps down all terrestrial
things which tend towards the heavens, and the same
force attracts to itself those things which do not go there
spontaneously. The showers fall, mists rise up, rivers are
dried up, hail-storms rush down, the rays of the sun parch
the earth, and impel it from all quarters towards the centre.
The same rays, still unbroken, dart back again, and carry
with them whatever they can take up. Vapour falls from
on high and returns again to the same place. Winds arise
which contain nothing, but which return loaded with spoils.
The breathing of so many animals draws down the spirit from
the higher regions; but this tends to go in a contrary direction,
and the earth pours out its spirit into the void space
of the heavens. Thus nature moving to and fro, as if impelled
by some machine<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>, discord is kindled by the rapid
motion of the world. Nor is the contest allowed to cease,
for she is continually whirled round and lays open the causes
of all things, forming an immense globe about the earth,
while she again, from time to time, covers this other firmament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
with clouds<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>. This is the region of the winds. Here
their nature principally originates, as well as the causes of
almost all other things<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a>; since most persons ascribe the
darting of thunder and lightning to their violence. And to
the same cause are assigned the showers of stones, these
having been previously taken up by the wind, as well as
many other bodies in the same way. On this account we
must enter more at large on this subject.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_39">CHAP. 39. (39.)—OF THE STATED SEASONS.</h3></div>

<p>It is obvious that there are causes of the seasons and of
other things which have been stated, while there are some
things which are casual, or of which the reason has not yet
been discovered. For who can doubt that summer and
winter, and the annual revolution of the seasons are caused
by the motion of the stars<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a>? As therefore the nature of the
sun is understood to influence the temperature of the year,
so each of the other stars has its specific power, which produces
its appropriate effects. Some abound in a fluid retaining
its liquid state, others, in the same fluid concreted
into hoar frost, compressed into snow, or frozen into hail;
some are prolific in winds, some in heat, some in vapours,
some in dew, some in cold. But these bodies must not be
supposed to be actually of the size which they appear, since
the consideration of their immense height clearly proves,
that none of them are less than the moon. Each of them
exercises its influence over us by its own motions; this is
particularly observable with respect to Saturn, which produces
a great quantity of rain in its transits. Nor is this
power confined to the stars which change their situations,
but is found to exist in many of the fixed stars, whenever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
they are impelled by the force of any of the planets, or excited
by the impulse of their rays; as we find to be the case
with respect to the Suculæ<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a>, which the Greeks, in reference
to their rainy nature, have termed the Hyades<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>. There are
also certain events which occur spontaneously, and at stated
periods, as the rising of the Kids<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a>. The star Arcturus
scarcely ever rises without storms of hail occurring.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_40">CHAP. 40. (40.)—OF THE RISING OF THE DOG-STAR.</h3></div>

<p>Who is there that does not know that the vapour of the
sun is kindled by the rising of the Dog-star? The most
powerful effects are felt on the earth from this star. When
it rises, the seas are troubled, the wines in our cellars ferment,
and stagnant waters are set in motion. There is a
wild beast, named by the Egyptians Oryx, which, when the
star rises, is said to stand opposite to it, to look steadfastly
at it, and then to sneeze, as if it were worshiping it<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a>. There
is no doubt that dogs, during the whole of this period, are
peculiarly disposed to become rabid<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_41">CHAP. 41. (41.)—OF THE REGULAR INFLUENCE OF THE DIFFERENT
SEASONS.</h3></div>

<p>There is moreover a peculiar influence in the different
degrees of certain signs, as in the autumnal equinox, and
also in the winter solstice, when we find that a particular
star is connected with the state of the weather<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a>. It is not
so much the recurrence of showers and storms, as of various
circumstances, which act both upon animals and vegetables.
Some are planet-struck<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>, and others, at stated times, are affected
in the bowels, the sinews, the head, or the intellect.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
The olive, the white poplar, and the willow turn their leaves
round at the summer solstice. The herb pulegium, when
dried and hanging up in a house, blossoms on the very day
of the winter solstice, and bladders burst in consequence of
their being distended with air<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>. One might wonder at this,
did we not observe every day, that the plant named heliotrope
always looks towards the setting sun, and is, at all
hours, turned towards him, even when he is obscured by
clouds<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a>. It is certain that the bodies of oysters and of
whelks<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a>, and of shell-fish generally, are increased in size and
again diminished by the influence of the moon. Certain
accurate observers have found out, that the entrails of the
field-mouse<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> correspond in number to the moon’s age, and
that the very small animal, the ant, feels the power of this
luminary, always resting from her labours at the change of
the moon. And so much the more disgraceful is our ignorance,
as every one acknowledges that the diseases in the
eyes of certain beasts of burden increase and diminish according
to the age of the moon. But the immensity of the
heavens, divided as they are into seventy-two<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> constellations,
may serve as an excuse. These are the resemblances of certain
things, animate and inanimate, into which the learned
have divided the heavens. In these they have announced
1600 stars, as being remarkable either for their effects or
their appearance; for example, in the tail of the Bull there
are seven stars, which are named Vergiliæ<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>; in his forehead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
are the Suculæ; there is also Bootes, which follows the seven
northern stars<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_42">CHAP. 42. (42.)—OF UNCERTAIN STATES OF THE WEATHER.</h3></div>

<p>But I would not deny, that there may exist showers and
winds, independent of these causes, since it is certain that
an exhalation proceeds from the earth, which is sometimes
moist, and at other times, in consequence of the vapours,
like dense smoke; and also, that clouds are formed, either
from the fluid rising up on high, or from the air being compressed
into a fluid<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a>. Their density and their substance is
very clearly proved from their intercepting the sun’s rays,
which are visible by divers, even in the deepest waters<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_43">CHAP. 43. (43.)—OF THUNDER AND LIGHTNING.</h3></div>

<p>It cannot therefore be denied, that fire proceeding from
the stars which are above the clouds, may fall on them, as
we frequently observe on serene evenings, and that the air is
agitated by the impulse, as darts when they are hurled whiz
through the air. And when it arrives at the cloud, a discordant
kind of vapour is produced, as when hot iron is
plunged into water, and a wreath of smoke is evolved. Hence
arise squalls. And if wind or vapour be struggling in the
cloud, thunder is discharged; if it bursts out with a flame,
there is a thunderbolt; if it be long in forcing out its way,
it is simply a flash of lightning<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a>. By the latter the cloud is
simply rent, by the former it is shattered. Thunder is produced<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
by the stroke given to the condensed air, and hence
it is that the fire darts from the chinks of the clouds. It is
possible also that the vapour, which has risen from the earth,
being repelled by the stars, may produce thunder, when it is
pent up in a cloud; nature restraining the sound whilst the
vapour is struggling to escape, but when it does escape, the
sound bursting forth, as is the case with bladders that are
distended with air. It is possible also that the spirit, whatever
it be, may be kindled by friction, when it is so violently
projected. It is possible that, by the dashing of the two
clouds, the lightning may flash out, as is the case when two
stones are struck against each other. But all these things
appear to be casual. Hence there are thunderbolts which
produce no effect, and proceed from no immediate actual
cause; by these mountains and seas are struck, and no injury
is done. Those which prognosticate future events proceed
from on high and from stated causes, and they come
from their peculiar stars<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_44">CHAP. 44.—THE ORIGIN OF WINDS.</h3></div>

<p>In like manner I would not deny that winds, or rather
sudden gusts, are produced by the arid and dry vapours of
the earth; that air may also be exhaled from water, which
can neither be condensed into a mist, nor compressed into a
cloud; that it may be also driven forward by the impulse of
the sun, since by the term ‘wind’ we mean nothing more than
a current of air, by whatever means it may be produced<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a>.
For we observe winds to proceed from rivers and bays, and
from the sea, even when it is tranquil; while others, which
are named <em>Altani</em>, rise up from the earth; when they come
back from the sea they are named <em>Tropæi</em>, but if they go
straight on, <em>Apogæi</em><a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span></p>

<p>(44.) The windings and the numerous peaks of mountains,
their ridges, bent into angles or broken into defiles, with the
hollow valleys, by their irregular forms, cleaving the air which
rebounds from them (which is also the cause why voices are,
in many cases, repeated several times in succession), give rise
to winds.</p>

<p>(45.) There are certain caves, such as that on the coast of
Dalmatia, with a vast perpendicular chasm, into which, if a
light weight only be let down, and although the day be calm,
a squall issues from it like a whirlwind. The name of the
place is Senta. And also, in the province of Cyrenaica, there
is a certain rock, said to be sacred to the south wind, which
it is profane for a human hand to touch, as the south wind
immediately rolls forwards clouds of sand<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a>. There are also,
in many houses, artificial cavities, formed in the walls<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>, which
produce currents of air; none of these are without their
appropriate cause.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_45">CHAP. 45.—VARIOUS OBSERVATIONS RESPECTING
WINDS.</h3></div>

<p>But there is a great difference between a gale and a wind<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a>.
The former are uniform and appear to rush forth<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a>; they are
felt, not in certain spots only, but over whole countries, not
forming breezes or squalls, but violent storms<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a>. Whether
they be produced by the constant revolution of the world
and the opposite motion of the stars, or whether they both
of them depend on the generative spirit of the nature of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
things, wandering, as it were, up and down in her womb, or
whether the air be scourged by the irregular strokes of the
wandering stars<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>, or the various projections of their rays, or
whether they, each of them, proceed from their own stars,
among which are those that are nearest to us, or whether
they descend from those that are fixed in the heavens, it is
manifest that they are all governed by a law of nature, which
is not altogether unknown, although it be not completely
ascertained.</p>

<p>(46.) More than twenty old Greek writers have published
their observations upon this subject. And this is the more remarkable,
seeing that there is so much discord in the world,
and that it is divided into different kingdoms, that is into
separate members, that there should have been so many who
have paid attention to these subjects, which are so difficult
to investigate. Especially when we consider the wars and
the treachery which everywhere prevail; while pirates, the
enemies of the human race, have possession of all the modes
of communication, so that, at this time, a person may acquire
more correct information about a country from the writings
of those who have never been there, than from the inhabitants
themselves. Whereas, at this day, in the blessed
peace which we enjoy, under a prince who so greatly encourages
the advancement of the arts, no new inquiries are
set on foot, nor do we even make ourselves thoroughly masters
of the discoveries of the ancients. Not that there were
greater rewards held out, from the advantages being distributed
to a greater number of persons, but that there were
more individuals who diligently scrutinized these matters,
with no other prospect but that of benefiting posterity. It
is that the manners of men are degenerated, not that the
advantages are diminished. All the seas, as many as there
are, being laid open, and a hospitable reception being given
us at every shore, an immense number of people undertake
voyages; but it is for the sake of gain, not of science. Nor
does their understanding, which is blinded and bent only on
avarice, perceive that this very thing might be more safely
done by means of science. Seeing, therefore, that there are
so many thousands of persons on the seas, I will treat of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
winds with more minuteness than perhaps might otherwise
appear suitable to my undertaking.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_46">CHAP. 46. (47.)—THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF WINDS<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a>.</h3></div>

<p>The ancients reckoned only four winds (nor indeed does
Homer mention more<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a>) corresponding to the four parts of
the world; a very poor reason, as we now consider it. The
next generation added eight others, but this was too refined
and minute a division; the moderns have taken a middle
course, and, out of this great number, have added four to the
original set. There are, therefore, two in each of the four
quarters of the heavens. From the equinoctial rising of the
sun<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> proceeds Subsolanus<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a>, and, from his brumal rising, Vulturnus<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>;
the former is named by the Greeks Apeliotes<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a>, the
latter Eurus. From the south we have Auster, and from the
brumal setting of the sun, Africus; these were named Notos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
and Libs. From the equinoctial setting proceeds Favonius<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a>,
and from the solstitial setting, Corus<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a>; these were named
Zephyrus and Argestes. From the seven stars comes Septemtrio,
between which and the solstitial rising we have
Aquilo, named Aparctias and Boreas<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a>. By a more minute
subdivision we interpose four others, Thrascias, between
Septemtrio and the solstitial setting; Cæcias, between Aquilo
and the equinoctial rising; and Phœnices, between the brumal
rising and the south. And also, at an equal distance from
the south and the winter setting, between Libs and Notos,
and compounded of the two, is Libonotos. Nor is this all.
For some persons have added a wind, which they have named
Meses, between Boreas and Cæcias, and one between Eurus
and Notos, named Euronotus<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a>.</p>

<p>There are also certain winds peculiar to certain countries,
which do not extend beyond certain districts, as Sciron in
Attica, deviating a little from Argestes, and not known in
the other parts of Greece. In other places it is a little
higher on the card and is named Olympias; but all these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
have gone by the name of Argestes. In some places Cæcias
is named Hellespontia, and the same is done in other cases.
In the province of Narbonne the most noted wind is Circius;
it is not inferior to any of the winds in violence, frequently
driving the waves before it, to Ostia<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a>, straight across the Ligurian
sea. Yet this same wind is unknown in other parts,
not even reaching Vienne, a city in the same province; for
meeting with a high ridge of hills, just before it arrives at
that district, it is checked, although it be the most violent of
all the winds. Fabius also asserts, that the south winds
never penetrate into Egypt. Hence this law of nature is
obvious, that winds have their stated seasons and limits.</p>

<p>The spring opens the seas for the navigators. In the beginning
of this season the west winds soften, as it were, the
winter sky, the sun having now gained the 25th degree of
Aquarius; this is on the sixth day before the Ides of February<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a>.
This agrees, for the most part, with all the remarks that I
shall subsequently make, only anticipating the period by one
day in the intercalary year, and again, preserving the same
order in the succeeding lustrum<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a>. After the eighth day before
the Calends of March<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a>, Favonius is called by some Chelidonias<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a>,
from the swallows making their appearance. The
wind, which blows for the space of nine days, from the seventy-first
day after the winter solstice<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a>, is sometimes called Ornithias,
from the arrival of the birds<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a>. In the contrary direction
to Favonius is the wind which we name Subsolanus, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
this is connected with the rising of the Vergiliæ, in the 25th
degree of Taurus, six days before the Ides of May<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a>, which is
the time when south winds prevail: these are opposite to
Septemtrio. The dog-star rises in the hottest time of the
summer, when the sun is entering the first degree of Leo<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>;
this is fifteen days before the Calends of August. The north
winds, which are called Prodromi<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a>, precede its rising by about
eight days. But in two days after its rising, the same north
winds, which are named Etesiæ<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a>, blow more constantly during
this period; the vapour from the sun, being increased twofold
by the heat of this star, is supposed to render these winds
more mild; nor are there any which are more regular. After
these the south winds become more frequent, until the appearance
of Arcturus<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a>, which rises eleven days before the autumnal
equinox. At this time Corus sets in; Corus is an autumnal
wind, and is in the opposite direction to Vulturnus. After
this, and generally for forty-four days after the equinox, at
the setting of the Vergiliæ, the winter commences, which
usually happens on the third of the Ides of November<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a>. This
is the period of the winter north wind, which is very unlike
the summer north wind, and which is in the opposite direction
to Africus. For seven days before the winter solstice,
and for the same length of time after it, the sea becomes
calm, in order that the king-fishers may rear their young;
from this circumstance they have obtained the name of the
halcyon days<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a>; the rest of the season is winterly<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a>. Yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
severity of the storms does not entirely close up the sea.
In former times, pirates were compelled, by the fear of death,
to rush into death, and to brave the winter ocean; now we
are driven to it by avarice<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_48">CHAP. 48.—NATURE OF THE WINDS<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>.</h3></div>

<p>Those are the coldest winds which are said to blow from
the seven stars, and Corus, which is contiguous to them;
these also restrain the others and dispel the clouds. The
moist winds are Africus, and, still more, the Auster of Italy.
It is said that, in Pontus, Cæcias attracts the clouds. The
dry winds are Corus and Vulturnus, especially when they
are about to cease blowing. The winds that bring snow are
Aquilo and Septemtrio; Septemtrio brings hail, and so does
Corus; Auster is sultry, Vulturnus and Zephyrus are warm.
These winds are more dry than Subsolanus, and generally
those which blow from the north and west are more dry than
those which blow from the south and east. Aquilo is the
most healthy of them all; Auster is unhealthy, and more so
when dry; it is colder, perhaps because it is moist. Animals
are supposed to have less appetite for food when this wind is
blowing. The Etesiæ generally cease during the night, and
spring up at the third hour of the day<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a>. In Spain and in
Asia these winds have an easterly direction, in Pontus a
northerly, and in other places a southerly direction. They
blow also after the winter solstice, when they are called Ornithiæ<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a>,
but they are more gentle and continue only for a
few days. There are two winds which change their nature
with their situation; in Africa Auster is attended with a
clear sky, while Aquilo collects the clouds<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a>. Almost all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
winds blow in their turn, so that when one ceases its opposite
springs up. When winds which are contiguous succeed
each other, they go from left to right, in the direction of the
sun. The fourth day of the moon generally determines their
direction for the whole of the monthly period<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a>. We are able
to sail in opposite directions by means of the same wind, if
we have the sails properly set; hence it frequently happens
that, in the night, vessels going in different directions run
against each other. Auster produces higher winds than
Aquilo, because the former blows, as it were, from the bottom
of the sea, while the latter blows on the surface; it is
therefore after south winds that the most mischievous earthquakes
have occurred. Auster is more violent during the
night, Aquilo during the day; winds from the east continue
longer than from the west. The north winds generally cease
blowing on the odd days, and we observe the prevalence of
the odd numbers in many other parts of nature; the male
winds are therefore regulated by the odd numbers<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a>. The
sun sometimes increases and sometimes restrains winds;
when rising and setting it increases them; while, when on
the meridian, it restrains them during the summer. They
are, therefore, generally lulled during the middle of the day
and of the night, because they are abated either by excessive
cold or heat; winds are also lulled by showers. We generally
expect them to come from that quarter where the clouds
open and allow the clear sky to be seen. Eudoxus<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> supposes
that the same succession of changes occurs in them
after a period of four years, if we observe their minute revolutions;
and this applies not only to winds, but to whatever
concerns the state of the weather. He begins his lustrum
at the rising of the dog-star, in the intercalary year.
So far concerning winds in general.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_49">CHAP. 49. (48.)—ECNEPHIAS AND TYPHON.</h3></div>

<p>And now respecting the sudden gusts<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a>, which arising from
the exhalations of the earth, as has been said above, and
falling down again, being in the mean time covered by a
thin film of clouds, exist in a variety of forms. By their
wandering about, and rushing down like torrents, in the
opinion of some persons, they produce thunder and lightning<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a>.
But if they be urged on with greater force and
violence, so as to cause the rupture of a dry cloud, they produce
a squall<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a>, which is named by the Greeks Ecnephias<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a>.
But, if these are compressed, and rolled up more closely together,
and then break without any discharge of fire, i. e.
without thunder, they produce a squall, which is named Typhon<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a>,
or an Ecnephias in a state of agitation. It carries
along a portion of the cloud which it has broken off, rolling
it and turning it round, aggravating its own destruction by
the weight of it, and whirling it from place to place. This
is very much dreaded by sailors, as it not only breaks their
sail-yards, but the vessels themselves, bending them about
in various ways. This may be in a slight degree counteracted
by sprinkling it with vinegar, when it comes near us,
this substance being of a very cold nature<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>. This wind,
when it rebounds after the stroke, absorbs and carries up
whatever it may have seized on.</p>

<p>But if it burst from the cavity of a cloud which is more
depressed, but less capacious than what produces a squall,
and is accompanied by noise, it is called a whirlwind, and
throws down everything which is near it. The same, when
it is more burning and rages with greater heat, is called a
blasting wind<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a>, scorching and, at the same time, throwing
down everything with which it comes in contact. (49.) Typhon
never comes from the north, nor have we Ecnephias
when it snows, or when there is snow on the ground. If it
breaks the clouds, and, at the same time, catches fire or
burns, but not until it has left the cloud, it forms a thunder-bolt.
It differs from Prester as flame does from fire; the
former is diffused in a gust, the latter is condensed with a
violent impulse<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>. The whirlwind, when it rebounds, differs
from the tornado in the same manner as a loud noise does
from a dash.</p>

<p>The squall differs from both of them in its extent, the
clouds being more properly rent asunder than broken into
pieces. A black cloud is formed, resembling a great animal,
an appearance much dreaded by sailors. It is also called a
pillar, when the moisture is so condensed and rigid as to be
able to support itself. It is a cloud of the same kind, which,
when drawn into a tube, sucks up the water<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_51">CHAP. 51. (50.)—OF THUNDER<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a>; IN WHAT COUNTRIES IT
DOES NOT FALL, AND FOR WHAT REASON.</h3></div>

<p>Thunder is rare both in winter and in summer<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a>, but from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
different causes; the air, which is condensed in the winter,
is made still more dense by a thicker covering of clouds,
while the exhalations from the earth, being all of them rigid
and frozen, extinguish whatever fiery vapour it may receive.
It is this cause which exempts Scythia and the cold districts
round it from thunder. On the other hand, the excessive
heat exempts Egypt; the warm and dry vapours of the earth
being very seldom condensed, and that only into light clouds.
But, in the spring and autumn, thunder is more frequent,
the causes which produce summer and winter being, in each
season, less efficient. From this cause thunder is more frequent
in Italy, the air being more easily set in motion, in
consequence of a milder winter and a showery summer, so
that it may be said to be always spring or autumn. Also in
those parts of Italy which recede from the north and lie towards
the south, as in the district round our city, and in
Campania, it lightens equally both in winter and in summer,
which is not the case in other situations.</p>

AND THEIR WONDERFUL EFFECTS.</h3></div>

<p>We have accounts of many different kinds of thunder-storms.
Those which are dry do not burn objects, but dissipate them;
while those which are moist do not burn, but blacken them.
There is a third kind, which is called bright lightning<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a>, of a
very wonderful nature, by which casks are emptied, without
the vessels themselves being injured, or there being any other
trace left of their operation<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a>. Gold, copper, and silver are
melted, while the bags which contain them are not in the
least burned, nor even the wax seal much defaced. Marcia,
a lady of high rank at Rome, was struck while pregnant;
the fœtus was destroyed, while she herself survived without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
suffering any injury<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>. Among the prognostics which took
place at the time of Catiline’s conspiracy, M. Herennius, a
magistrate of the borough of Pompeii, was struck by lightning
when the sky was without clouds<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_53">CHAP. 53. (52.)—THE ETRURIAN<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a> AND THE ROMAN
OBSERVATIONS ON THESE POINTS.</h3></div>

<p>The Tuscan books inform us, that there are nine Gods
who discharge thunder-storms, that there are eleven different
kinds of them, and that three of them are darted out by
Jupiter. Of these the Romans retained only two, ascribing
the diurnal kind to Jupiter, and the nocturnal to Summanus<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a>;
this latter kind being more rare, in consequence of
the heavens being colder, as was mentioned above. The
Etrurians also suppose, that those which are named Infernal
burst out of the ground; they are produced in the winter
and are particularly fierce and direful, as all things are which
proceed from the earth, and are not generated by or proceeding
from the stars, but from a cause which is near at hand,
and of a more disorderly nature. As a proof of this it is
said, that all those which proceed from the higher regions
strike obliquely, while those which are termed terrestrial
strike in a direct line. And because these fall from matter
which is nearer to us, they are supposed to proceed from the
earth, since they leave no traces of a rebound; this being
the effect of a stroke coming not from below, but from an
opposite quarter. Those who have searched into the subject<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
more minutely suppose, that these come from the planet
Saturn, as those that are of a burning nature do from Mars.
In this way it was that Volsinium, the most opulent town of
the Tuscans, was entirely consumed by lightning<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a>. The
first of these strokes that a man receives, after he has come
into possession of any property, is termed <em>Familiar</em><a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a>, and is
supposed to prognosticate the events of the whole of his life.
But it is not generally supposed that they predict events of
a private nature for a longer space than ten years, unless
they happen at the time of a first marriage or a birth-day;
nor that public predictions extend beyond thirty years<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a>, unless
with respect to the founding of colonies<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_54">CHAP. 54. (53.)—OF CONJURING UP THUNDER.</h3></div>

<p>It is related in our Annals, that by certain sacred rites
and imprecations, thunder-storms may be compelled or invoked<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a>.
There is an old report in Etruria, that thunder was
invoked when the city of Volsinium had its territory laid
waste by a monster named Volta<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a>. Thunder was also invoked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
by King Porsenna. And L. Piso<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a>, a very respectable
author, states in the first book of his Annals, that this had
been frequently done before his time by Numa, and that
Tullus Hostilius, imitating him, but not having properly
performed the ceremonies, was struck with the lightning<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a>.
We have also groves, and altars, and sacred places, and, among
the titles of Jupiter, as Stator, Tonans, and Feretrius, we
have a Jupiter Elicius<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a>. The opinions entertained on this
point are very various, and depend much on the dispositions
of different individuals. To believe that we can command
nature is the mark of a bold mind, nor is it less the mark of
a feeble one to reject her kindness<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>. Our knowledge has
been so far useful to us in the interpretation of thunder,
that it enables us to predict what is to happen on a certain
day, and we learn either that our fortune is to be entirely
changed, or it discloses events which are concealed from us;
as is proved by an infinite number of examples, public and
private. Wherefore let these things remain, according to
the order of nature, to some persons certain, to others doubtful,
by some approved, by others condemned. I must not,
however, omit the other circumstances connected with them
which deserve to be related.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_55">CHAP. 55. (54.)—GENERAL LAWS OF LIGHTNING.</h3></div>

<p>It is certain that the lightning is seen before the thunder
is heard, although they both take place at the same time.
Nor is this wonderful, since light has a greater velocity than
sound. Nature so regulates it, that the stroke and the sound
coincide<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a>; the sound is, however, produced by the discharge
of the thunder, not by its stroke. But the air is impelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
quicker than the lightning<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a>, on which account it is that everything
is shaken and blown up before it is struck, and that a
person is never injured when he has seen the lightning and
heard the thunder. Thunder on the left hand is supposed
to be lucky, because the east is on the left side of the heavens<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a>.
We do not regard so much the mode in which it comes
to us, as that in which it leaves us, whether the fire rebounds
after the stroke, or whether the current of air returns when
the operation is concluded and the fire is consumed. In relation
to this object the Etrurians have divided the heavens into
sixteen parts<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a>. The first great division is from north to east;
the second to the south; the third to the west, and the fourth
occupies what remains from west to north. Each of these has
been subdivided into four parts, of which the eight on the east
have been called the left, and those on the west the right divisions.
Those which extend from the west to the north have
been considered the most unpropitious. It becomes therefore
very important to ascertain from what quarter the thunder
proceeds, and in what direction it falls. It is considered a
very favourable omen when it returns into the eastern divisions.
But it prognosticates the greatest felicity when the
thunder proceeds from the first-mentioned part of the heavens
and falls back into it; it was an omen of this kind which, as we
have heard, was given to Sylla, the Dictator. The remaining
quarters of the heavens are less propitious, and also less to
be dreaded. There are some kinds of thunder which it is
not thought right to speak of, or even to listen to, unless
when they have been disclosed to the master of a family or
to a parent. But the futility of this observation was detected
when the temple of Juno was struck at Rome, during<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
the consulship of Scaurus, he who was afterwards the Prince
of the Senate<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a>.</p>

<p>It lightens without thunder more frequently in the night
than in the day<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>. Man is the only animal that is not always
killed by it, all other animals being killed instantly, nature
having granted to him this mark of distinction, while so many
other animals excel him in strength. All animals fall down
on the opposite side to that which has been struck; man,
unless he be thrown down on the parts that are struck, does
not expire. Those who are struck directly from above sink
down immediately. When a man is struck while he is awake,
he is found with his eyes closed; when asleep, with them
open. It is not considered proper that a man killed in this
way should be burnt on the funeral pile; our religion enjoins
us to bury the body in the earth<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a>. No animal is consumed
by lightning unless after having been previously killed.
The parts of the animal that have been wounded by lightning
are colder than the rest of the body.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_56">CHAP. 56. (55.)—OBJECTS WHICH ARE NEVER STRUCK.</h3></div>

<p>Among the productions of the earth, thunder never strikes
the laurel<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a>, nor does it descend more than five feet into the
earth. Those, therefore, who are timid consider the deepest
caves as the most safe; or tents made of the skins of the
animal called the sea-calf, since this is the only marine animal
which is never struck<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a>; as is the case, among birds, with
the eagle; on this account it is represented as the bearer of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
this weapon<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a>. In Italy, between Terracina and the temple
of Feronia, the people have left off building towers in time
of war, every one of them having been destroyed by thunderbolts.</p>

<p>Besides these, we learn from certain monuments, that from
the lower part of the atmosphere<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a> it rained milk and blood,
in the consulship of M’ Acilius and C. Porcius, and frequently
at other times<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a>. This was the case with respect to flesh, in
the consulship of P. Volumnius and Servius Sulpicius, and it
is said, that what was not devoured by the birds did not become
putrid. It also rained iron among the Lucanians, the
year before Crassus was slain by the Parthians, as well as all
the Lucanian soldiers, of whom there was a great number in
this army. The substance which fell had very much the appearance
of sponge<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a>; the augurs warned the people against<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
wounds that might come from above. In the consulship of
L. Paulus and C. Marcellus it rained wool, round the castle
of Carissanum, near which place, a year after, T. Annius Milo
was killed. It is recorded, among the transactions of that
year, that when he was pleading his own cause, there was a
shower of baked tiles.</p>

before and since<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a>. Also, that in the third consulship of

CLOUDS<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a>. THE OPINION OF ANAXAGORAS RESPECTING
THEM.</h3></div>

<p>The Greeks boast that Anaxagoras<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a>, the Clazomenian, in
the second year of the 78th Olympiad, from his knowledge
of what relates to the heavens, had predicted, that at a certain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
time, a stone would fall from the sun<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a>. And the thing accordingly
happened, in the daytime, in a part of Thrace, at
the river Ægos. The stone is now to be seen, a waggon-load
in size and of a burnt appearance; there was also a
comet shining in the night at that time<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a>. But to believe
that this had been predicted would be to admit that the divining
powers of Anaxagoras were still more wonderful, and
that our knowledge of the nature of things, and indeed every
thing else, would be thrown into confusion, were we to suppose
either that the sun is itself composed of stone, or that
there was even a stone in it; yet there can be no doubt that
stones have frequently fallen from the atmosphere. There
is a stone, a small one indeed, at this time, in the Gymnasium
of Abydos, which on this account is held in veneration,
and which the same Anaxagoras predicted would fall in the
middle of the earth. There is another at Cassandria, formerly
called Potidæa<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a>, which from this circumstance was built in
that place. I have myself seen one in the country of the
Vocontii<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a>, which had been brought from the fields only a
short time before.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_60">CHAP. 60. (59.)—THE RAINBOW.</h3></div>

<p>What we name Rainbows frequently occur, and are not
considered either wonderful or ominous; for they do not
predict, with certainty, either rain or fair weather. It is
obvious, that the rays of the sun, being projected upon a
hollow cloud, the light is thrown back to the sun and is refracted<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a>,
and that the variety of colours is produced by a
mixture of clouds, air, and fire<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a>. The rainbow is certainly
never produced except in the part opposite to the sun, nor even
in any other form except that of a semicircle. Nor are they
ever formed at night, although Aristotle asserts that they are
sometimes seen at that time; he acknowledges, however, that
it can only be on the 14th day of the moon<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a>. They are seen
in the winter the most frequently, when the days are shortening,
after the autumnal equinox<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a>. They are not seen when
the days increase again, after the vernal equinox, nor on the
longest days, about the summer solstice, but frequently at
the winter solstice, when the days are the shortest. When
the sun is low they are high, and when the sun is high they
are low; they are smaller when in the east or west, but are
spread out wider; in the south they are small, but of a
greater span. In the summer they are not seen at noon,
but after the autumnal equinox at any hour: there are never
more than two seen at once.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_61">CHAP. 61.—THE NATURE OF HAIL, SNOW, HOAR, MIST,
DEW; THE FORMS OF CLOUDS.</h3></div>

<p>I do not find that there is any doubt entertained respecting
the following points. (60.) Hail is produced by frozen rain,
and snow by the same fluid less firmly concreted, and hoar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
by frozen dew<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a>. During the winter snow falls, but not hail;
hail itself falls more frequently during the day than the night,
and is more quickly melted than snow. There are no mists
either in the summer or during the greatest cold of winter.
There is neither dew nor hoar formed during great heat or
winds, nor unless the night be serene. Fluids are diminished
in bulk by being frozen, and, when the ice is melted, we do
not obtain the same quantity of fluid as at first<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a>.</p>

<p>(61.) The clouds are varied in their colour and figure according
as the fire which they contain is in excess or is absorbed
by them.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_62">CHAP. 62. (62.)—THE PECULIARITIES OF THE WEATHER IN
DIFFERENT PLACES.</h3></div>

<p>There are, moreover, certain peculiarities in certain places.
In Africa dew falls during the night in summer. In Italy,
at Locri, and at the Lake Velinum, there is never a day
in which a rainbow is not seen<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a>. At Rhodes and at Syracuse
the sky is never so covered with clouds, but that the sun is
visible at one time or another; these things, however, will
be better detailed in their proper place. So far respecting
the air.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_63">CHAP. 63. (63.)—NATURE OF THE EARTH.</h3></div>

<p>Next comes the earth, on which alone of all parts of nature
we have bestowed the name that implies maternal veneration.
It is appropriated to man as the heavens are to God.
She receives us at our birth, nourishes us when born, and
ever afterwards supports us; lastly, embracing us in her
bosom when we are rejected by the rest of nature, she then
covers us with especial tenderness; rendered sacred to us,
inasmuch as she renders us sacred, bearing our monuments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
and titles, continuing our names, and extending our memory,
in opposition to the shortness of life. In our anger we imprecate
her on those who are now no more<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a>, as if we were
ignorant that she is the only being who can never be angry
with man. The water passes into showers, is concreted into
hail, swells into rivers, is precipitated in torrents; the air is
condensed into clouds, rages in squalls; but the earth, kind,
mild, and indulgent as she is, and always ministering to the
wants of mortals, how many things do we compel her to
produce spontaneously! What odours and flowers, nutritive
juices, forms and colours! With what good faith does she
render back all that has been entrusted to her! It is the
vital spirit which must bear the blame of producing noxious
animals; for the earth is constrained to receive the seeds of
them, and to support them when they are produced. The
fault lies in the evil nature which generates them. The
earth will no longer harbour a serpent after it has attacked
any one<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a>, and thus she even demands punishment in the
name of those who are indifferent about it themselves<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a>. She
pours forth a profusion of medicinal plants, and is always
producing something for the use of man. We may even
suppose, that it is out of compassion to us that she has ordained
certain substances to be poisonous, in order that when
we are weary of life, hunger, a mode of death the most foreign
to the kind disposition of the earth<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a>, might not consume us
by a slow decay, that precipices might not lacerate our
mangled bodies, that the unseemly punishment of the halter
may not torture us, by stopping the breath of one who seeks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
his own destruction, or that we may not seek our death in
the ocean, and become food for our graves, or that our bodies
may not be gashed by steel. On this account it is that nature
has produced a substance which is very easily taken, and
by which life is extinguished, the body remaining undefiled
and retaining all its blood, and only causing a degree of
thirst. And when it is destroyed by this means, neither
bird nor beast will touch the body, but he who has perished
by his own hands is reserved for the earth.</p>

<p>But it must be acknowledged, that everything which the
earth has produced, as a remedy for our evils, we have converted
into the poison of our lives. For do we not use iron,
which we cannot do without, for this purpose? But although
this cause of mischief has been produced, we ought not to
complain; we ought not to be ungrateful to this one part of
nature<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a>. How many luxuries and how many insults does
she not bear for us! She is cast into the sea, and, in order
that we may introduce seas into her bosom, she is washed
away by the waves. She is continually tortured for her iron, her
timber, stone, fire, corn, and is even much more subservient
to our luxuries than to our mere support. What indeed she
endures on her surface might be tolerated, but we penetrate
also into her bowels, digging out the veins of gold and silver,
and the ores of copper and lead; we also search for gems and
certain small pebbles, driving our trenches to a great depth.
We tear out her entrails in order to extract the gems with
which we may load our fingers. How many hands are worn
down that one little joint may be ornamented! If the infernal
regions really existed, certainly these burrows of avarice
and luxury would have penetrated into them. And truly
we wonder that this same earth should have produced anything
noxious! But, I suppose, the savage beasts protect
her and keep off our sacrilegious hands<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>. For do we not dig
among serpents and handle poisonous plants along with those
veins of gold? But the Goddess shows herself more propitious
to us, inasmuch as all this wealth ends in crimes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
slaughter, and war, and that, while we drench her with our
blood, we cover her with unburied bones; and being covered
with these and her anger being thus appeased, she conceals
the crimes of mortals<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a>. I consider the ignorance of her
nature as one of the evil effects of an ungrateful mind.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_64">CHAP. 64. (64.)—OF THE FORM OF THE EARTH.</h3></div>

<p>Every one agrees that it has the most perfect figure<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a>.
We always speak of the ball of the earth, and we admit it
to be a globe bounded by the poles. It has not indeed the
form of an absolute sphere, from the number of lofty mountains
and flat plains; but if the termination of the lines be
bounded by a curve<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>, this would compose a perfect sphere.
And this we learn from arguments drawn from the nature of
things, although not from the same considerations which we
made use of with respect to the heavens. For in these the
hollow convexity everywhere bends on itself, and leans upon
the earth as its centre. Whereas the earth rises up solid
and dense, like something that swells up and is protruded
outwards. The heavens bend towards the centre, while the
earth goes from the centre, the continual rolling of the
heavens about it forcing its immense globe into the form of
a sphere<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_65">CHAP. 65. (65.)—WHETHER THERE BE ANTIPODES?</h3></div>

<p>On this point there is a great contest between the learned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
and the vulgar. We maintain, that there are men dispersed
over every part of the earth, that they stand with their feet
turned towards each other, that the vault of the heavens appears
alike to all of them, and that they, all of them, appear to
tread equally on the middle of the earth. If any one should
ask, why those situated opposite to us do not fall, we directly
ask in return, whether those on the opposite side do not
wonder that we do not fall. But I may make a remark, that
will appear plausible even to the most unlearned, that if the
earth were of the figure of an unequal globe, like the seed of a
pine<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a>, still it may be inhabited in every part.</p>

<p>But of how little moment is this, when we have another
miracle rising up to our notice! The earth itself is pendent
and does not fall with us; it is doubtful whether this be from
the force of the spirit which is contained in the universe<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a>, or
whether it would fall, did not nature resist, by allowing of
no place where it might fall. For as the seat of fire is nowhere
but in fire, nor of water except in water, nor of air
except in air, so there is no situation for the earth except in
itself, everything else repelling it. It is indeed wonderful
that it should form a globe, when there is so much flat surface
of the sea and of the plains. And this was the opinion
of Dicæarchus, a peculiarly learned man, who measured the
heights of mountains, under the direction of the kings, and
estimated Pelion, which was the highest, at 1250 paces perpendicular,
and considered this as not affecting the round
figure of the globe. But this appears to me to be doubtful,
as I well know that the summits of some of the Alps rise
up by a long space of not less than 50,000 paces<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a>. But what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
the vulgar most strenuously contend against is, to be compelled
to believe that the water is forced into a rounded
figure<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>; yet there is nothing more obvious to the sight among
the phænomena of nature. For we see everywhere, that
drops, when they hang down, assume the form of small globes,
and when they are covered with dust, or have the down of
leaves spread over them, they are observed to be completely
round; and when a cup is filled, the liquid swells up in the
middle. But on account of the subtile nature of the fluid
and its inherent softness, the fact is more easily ascertained
by our reason than by our sight. And it is even more
wonderful, that if a very little fluid only be added to a cup
when it is full, the superfluous quantity runs over, whereas
the contrary happens if we add a solid body, even as much
as would weigh 20 denarii. The reason of this is, that what
is dropt in raises up the fluid at the top, while what is poured
on it slides off from the projecting surface. It is from
the same cause<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a> that the land is not visible from the body
of a ship when it may be seen from the mast; and that
when a vessel is receding, if any bright object be fixed to the
mast, it seems gradually to descend and finally to become
invisible. And the ocean, which we admit to be without
limits, if it had any other figure, could it cohere and exist
without falling, there being no external margin to contain
it? And the same wonder still recurs, how is it that the
extreme parts of the sea, although it be in the form of a
globe, do not fall down? In opposition to which doctrine,
the Greeks, to their great joy and glory, were the first to
teach us, by their subtile geometry, that this could not happen,
even if the seas were flat, and of the figure which they
appear to be. For since water always runs from a higher to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
a lower level, and this is admitted to be essential to it, no
one ever doubted that the water would accumulate on any
shore, as much as its slope would allow it. It is also certain,
that the lower anything is, so much the nearer is it to the
centre, and that all the lines which are drawn from this point
to the water which is the nearest to it, are shorter than those
which reach from the beginning of the sea to its extreme
parts<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a>. Hence it follows, that all the water, from every part,
tends towards the centre, and, because it has this tendency,
does not fall.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_66">CHAP. 66.—HOW THE WATER IS CONNECTED WITH THE EARTH.
OF THE NAVIGATION OF THE SEA AND THE RIVERS.</h3></div>

<p>We must believe, that the great artist, Nature, has so
arranged it, that as the arid and dry earth cannot subsist by
itself and without moisture, nor, on the other hand, can the
water subsist unless it be supported by the earth, they are
connected by a mutual union. The earth opens her harbours,
while the water pervades the whole earth, within, without,
and above; its veins running in all directions, like connecting
links, and bursting out on even the highest ridges;
where, forced up by the air, and pressed out by the weight
of the earth, it shoots forth as from a pipe, and is so far from
being in danger of falling, that it bounds up to the highest
and most lofty places. Hence the reason is obvious, why
the seas are not increased by the daily accession of so many
rivers<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a>.</p>

<p>(66.) The earth has, therefore, the whole of its globe girt,
on every side, by the sea flowing round it. And this is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
point to be investigated by arguments, but what has been
ascertained by experience.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_67">CHAP. 67. (67.)—WHETHER THE OCEAN SURROUNDS THE
EARTH.</h3></div>

<p>The whole of the western ocean is now navigated, from Gades
and the Pillars of Hercules, round Spain and Gaul. The
greater part of the northern ocean has also been navigated,
under the auspices of the Emperor Augustus, his fleet having
been carried round Germany to the promontory of the Cimbri<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a>;
from which spot they descried an immense sea, or became acquainted
with it by report, which extends to the country of
the Scythians, and the districts that are chilled by excessive
moisture<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a>. On this account it is not at all probable, that
the ocean should be deficient in a region where moisture so
much abounds. In like manner, towards the east, from the
Indian sea, all that part which lies in the same latitude<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a>, and
which bends round towards the Caspian<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a>, has been explored
by the Macedonian arms, in the reigns of Seleucus and Antiochus,
who wished it to be named after themselves, the Seleucian
or Antiochian Sea. About the Caspian, too, many parts
of the shores of the ocean have been explored, so that nearly
the whole of the north has been sailed over in one direction
or another. Nor can our argument be much affected by the
point that has been so much discussed, respecting the Palus
Mæotis, whether it be a bay of the same ocean<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a>, as is, I understand,
the opinion of some persons, or whether it be the
overflowing of a narrow channel connected with a different
ocean<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a>. On the other side of Gades, proceeding from
the same western point, a great part of the southern ocean,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
along Mauritania, has now been navigated. Indeed the
greater part of this region, as well as of the east, as far as the
Arabian Gulf, was surveyed in consequence of Alexander’s
victories. When Caius Cæsar, the son of Augustus<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a>, had the
conduct of affairs in that country, it is said that they found the
remains of Spanish vessels which had been wrecked there.
While the power of Carthage was at its height, Hanno published
an account of a voyage which he made from Gades to
the extremity of Arabia<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>; Himilco was also sent, about the
same time, to explore the remote parts of Europe. Besides,
we learn from Corn. Nepos, that one Eudoxus, a contemporary
of his<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a>, when he was flying from king Lathyrus, set out from
the Arabian Gulf, and was carried as far as Gades<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a>. And long
before him, Cælius Antipater<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a> informs us, that he had seen
a person who had sailed from Spain to Æthiopia for the purposes
of trade. The same Cornelius Nepos, when speaking of
the northern circumnavigation, tells us that Q. Metellus Celer,
the colleague of L. Afranius in the consulship, but then a
proconsul in Gaul<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a>, had a present made to him by the king
of the Suevi, of certain Indians, who sailing from India for
the purpose of commerce, had been driven by tempests into
Germany<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a>. Thus it appears, that the seas which flow completely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
round the globe, and divide it, as it were, into two
parts<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a>, exclude us from one part of it, as there is no way open
to it on either side. And as the contemplation of these
things is adapted to detect the vanity of mortals, it seems
incumbent on me to display, and lay open to our eyes, the
whole of it, whatever it be, in which there is nothing which
can satisfy the desires of certain individuals.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_68">CHAP. 68. (68.)—WHAT PART OF THE EARTH IS INHABITED.</h3></div>

<p>In the first place, then, it appears, that this should be estimated
at half the globe<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>, as if no portion of this half was
encroached upon by the ocean. But surrounding as it does
the whole of the land, pouring out and receiving all the other
waters, furnishing whatever goes to the clouds, and feeding the
stars themselves, so numerous and of such great size as they
are, what a great space must we not suppose it to occupy!
This vast mass must fill up and occupy an infinite extent.
To this we must add that portion of the remainder which the
heavens<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> take from us. For the globe is divided into five
parts<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a>, termed zones, and all that portion is subject to severe
cold and perpetual frost which is under the two extremities,
about each of the poles, the nearer of which is called the
north, and the opposite the south, pole. In all these regions
there is perpetual darkness, and, in consequence of the aspect
of the milder stars being turned from them, the light is malignant,
and only like the whiteness which is produced by
hoar frost. The middle of the earth, over which is the orbit
of the sun, is parched and burned by the flame, and is consumed
by being so near the heat. There are only two of the
zones which are temperate, those which lie between the torrid
and the frigid zones, and these are separated from each other,
in consequence of the scorching heat of the heavenly bodies.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
It appears, therefore, that the heavens take from us three
parts of the earth; how much the ocean steals is uncertain.</p>

<p>And with respect to the part which is left us, I do not
know whether that is not even in greater danger. This same
ocean, insinuating itself, as I have described it, into a number
of bays, approaches with its roaring<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a> so near to the inland
seas, that the Arabian Gulf is no more than 115 miles
from the Egyptian Sea<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a>, and the Caspian only 375 miles from
the Euxine. It also insinuates itself into the numerous seas
by which it separates Africa, Europe, and Asia; hence how
much space must it occupy? We must also take into account
the extent of all the rivers and the marshes, and we
must add the lakes and the pools. There are also the mountains,
raised up to the heavens, with their precipitous fronts;
we must also subtract the forests and the craggy valleys, the
wildernesses, and the places, which, from various causes, are
desert. The vast quantity which remains of the earth<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a>, or
rather, as many persons have considered it, this speck of a
world<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> (for the earth is no more in regard to the universe),
this is the object, the seat of our glory—here we bear our
honours, here we exercise our power, here we covet wealth,
here we mortals create our disturbances, here we continually
carry on our wars, aye, civil wars, even, and unpeople the
earth by mutual slaughter. And not to dwell on public feuds,
entered into by nations against each other, here it is that we
drive away our neighbours, and enclose the land thus seized
upon within our own fence<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a>; and yet the man who has most
extended his boundary, and has expelled the inhabitants for
ever so great a distance, after all, what mighty portion of the
earth is he master of? And even when his avarice has been
the most completely satisfied, what part of it can he take
with him into the grave?</p>

<p>It is evident from undoubted arguments, that the earth is
in the middle of the universe<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a>, but it is the most clearly
proved by the equality of the days and the nights at the equinox<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a>.
It is demonstrated by the quadrant<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a>, which affords
the most decisive confirmation of the fact, that unless the
earth was in the middle, the days and nights could not be
equal; for, at the time of the equinox, the rising and setting
of the sun are seen on the same line, and the rising of the
sun, at the summer solstice, is on the same line with its
setting at the winter solstice; but this could not happen if
the earth was not situated in the centre.</p>

<p>The three circles<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a>, which are connected with the above-mentioned
zones, distinguish the inequalities of the seasons;
these are, the solstitial circle, which proceeds from the part
of the Zodiac the highest to us and approaching the nearest
to the district of the north; on the other side, the brumal,
which is towards the south pole; and the equinoctial, which
traverses the middle of the Zodiac.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_71">CHAP. 71.—OF THE INEQUALITY OF CLIMATES.</h3></div>

<p>The cause of the other things which are worthy of our
admiration depends on the figure of the earth itself, which,
together with all its waters, is proved, by the same arguments,
to be a globe. This certainly is the cause why the
stars of the northern portion of the heavens never set to us,
and why, on the other hand, those in the south never rise,
and again, why the latter can never be seen by the former,
the globe of the earth rising up and concealing them. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
Northern Wain is never seen in Troglodytice<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a>, nor in Egypt,
which borders on it<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a>; nor can we, in Italy, see the star Canopus<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a>,
or Berenice’s Hair<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a>; nor what, under the Emperor
Augustus, was named Cæsar’s Throne, although they are,
there<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a>, very brilliant stars. The curved form of the earth is
so obvious, rising up like a ridge, that Canopus appears to a
spectator at Alexandria to rise above the horizon almost the
quarter of a sign; the same star at Rhodes appears, as it
were, to graze along the earth, while in Pontus it is not seen
at all; where the Northern Wain appears considerably
elevated. This same constellation cannot be seen at Rhodes,
and still less at Alexandria. In Arabia, in the month of
November, it is concealed during the first watch of the
night, but may be seen during the second<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a>; in Meroë it is
seen, for a short time, in the evening, at the solstice, and it
is visible at day-break, for a few days before the rising of
Arcturus<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a>. These facts have been principally ascertained
by the expeditions of navigators; the sea appearing more
elevated or depressed in certain parts<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a>; the stars suddenly
coming into view, and, as it were, emerging from the water,
after having been concealed by the bulging out of the globe<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a>.
But the heavens do not, as some suppose, rise higher at one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
pole, otherwise<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> its stars would be seen from all parts of the
world; they indeed are supposed to be higher by those who
are nearest to them, but the stars are sunk below the horizon
to those who are more remote. As this pole appears to be
elevated to those who are beneath it; so, when we have
passed along the convexity of the earth, those stars rise up,
which appear elevated to the inhabitants of those other districts;
all this, however, could not happen unless the earth
had the shape of a globe.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_72">CHAP. 72.—IN WHAT PLACES ECLIPSES ARE INVISIBLE, AND
WHY THIS IS THE CASE.</h3></div>

<p>Hence it is that the inhabitants of the east do not see
those eclipses of the sun or of the moon which occur in the
evening, nor the inhabitants of the west those in the morning,
while such as take place at noon are more frequently
visible<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a>. We are told, that at the time of the famous victory
of Alexander the Great, at Arbela<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a>, the moon was
eclipsed at the second hour of the night, while, in Sicily, the
moon was rising at the same hour. The eclipse of the sun
which occurred the day before the calends of May, in the
consulship of Vipstanus and Fonteius<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a>, not many years ago,
was seen in Campania between the seventh and eighth hour
of the day; the general Corbulo informs us, that it was seen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
in Armenia, between the eleventh and twelfth hour<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a>; thus the
curve of the globe both reveals and conceals different objects
from the inhabitants of its different parts. If the earth had
been flat, everything would have been seen at the same time,
from every part of it, and the nights would not have been
unequal; while the equal intervals of twelve hours, which are
now observed only in the middle of the earth, would in that
case have been the same everywhere.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_73">CHAP. 73. (71.)—WHAT REGULATES THE DAYLIGHT ON THE
EARTH.</h3></div>

<p>Hence it is that there is not any one night and day the same,
in all parts of the earth, at the same time; the intervention of
the globe producing night, and its turning round producing
day<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a>. This is known by various observations. In Africa and
in Spain it is made evident by the Towers of Hannibal<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a>, and in
Asia by the beacons, which, in consequence of their dread of
pirates, the people erected for their protection; for it has been
frequently observed, that the signals, which were lighted at
the sixth hour of the day, were seen at the third hour of the
night by those who were the most remote<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a>. Philonides, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
courier of the above-mentioned Alexander, went from Sicyon
to Elis, a distance of 1200 stadia, in nine hours, while he
seldom returned until the third hour of the night, although
the road was down-hill<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a>. The reason is, that, in going, he
followed the course of the sun, while on his return, in the
opposite direction, he met the sun and left it behind him.
For the same reason it is, that those who sail to the west,
even on the shortest day, compensate for the difficulty of
sailing in the night and go farther<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a>, because they sail in the
same direction with the sun.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_74">CHAP. 74. (72.)—REMARKS ON DIALS, AS CONNECTED WITH
THIS SUBJECT.</h3></div>

<p>The same dial-plates<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a> cannot be used in all places, the
shadow of the sun being sensibly different at distances of
300, or at most of 500 stadia<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a>. Hence the shadow of the dial-pin,
which is termed the gnomon, at noon and at the summer
solstice, in Egypt, is a little more than half the length of the
gnomon itself. At the city of Rome it is only <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>9</sub> less than
the gnomon, at Ancona not more than <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>35</sub> less, while in
the part of Italy which is called Venetia, at the same hour,
the shadow is equal to the length of the gnomon<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_75">CHAP. 75. (73.)—WHEN AND WHERE THERE ARE NO
SHADOWS.</h3></div>

<p>It is likewise said, that in the town of Syene, which is
5000 stadia south of Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a>, there is no shadow at noon,
on the day of the solstice; and that a well, which was sunk
for the purpose of the experiment, is illuminated by the sun
in every part. Hence it appears that the sun, in this place,
is vertical, and Onesicritus informs us that this is the case,
about the same time, in India, at the river Hypasis<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a>. It is
well known, that at Berenice, a city of the Troglodytæ, and
4820 stadia beyond that city, in the same country, at the
town of Ptolemais, which was built on the Red Sea, when
the elephant was first hunted, this same thing takes place
for forty-five days before the solstice and for an equal length
of time after it, and that during these ninety days the shadows
are turned towards the south<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a>. Again, at Meroë, an island
in the Nile and the metropolis of the Æthiopians, which is
5000 stadia<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> from Syene, there are no shadows at two periods
of the year, viz. when the sun is in the 18th degree of Taurus
and in the 14th of Leo<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a>. The Oretes, a people of India, have
a mountain named Maleus<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a>, near which the shadows in summer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
fall towards the south and in winter towards the north.
The seven stars of the Great Bear are visible there for fifteen
nights only. In India also, in the celebrated sea-port Patale<a id="FNanchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor">514</a>,
the sun rises to the right hand and the shadows fall
towards the south. While Alexander was staying there it
was observed, that the seven northern stars were seen only
during the early part of the night<a id="FNanchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor">515</a>. Onesicritus, one of his
generals, informs us in his work, that in those places in India
where there are no shadows, the seven stars are not visible<a id="FNanchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor">516</a>;
these places, he says, are called “Ascia<a id="FNanchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor">517</a>,” and the people there
do not reckon the time by hours<a id="FNanchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor">518</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_76">CHAP. 76. (74.)—-WHERE THIS TAKES PLACE TWICE IN THE

<p>Eratosthenes informs us, that in the whole of Troglodytice,
for twice forty-five days in the year, the shadows fall in the
contrary direction<a id="FNanchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor">519</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_77">CHAP. 77. (75.)—WHERE THE DAYS ARE THE LONGEST AND

<p>Hence it follows, that in consequence of the daylight
increasing in various degrees, in Meroë the longest day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
consists of twelve æquinoctial hours and eight parts of an
hour<a id="FNanchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor">520</a>, at Alexandria of fourteen hours, in Italy of fifteen, in
Britain of seventeen; where the degree of light, which exists
in the night, very clearly proves, what the reason of the thing
also obliges us to believe, that, during the solstitial period,
as the sun approaches to the pole of the world, and his orbit
is contracted, the parts of the earth that lie below him have
a day of six months long, and a night of equal length when
he is removed to the south pole. Pytheas, of Marseilles<a id="FNanchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor">521</a>,
informs us, that this is the case in the island of Thule<a id="FNanchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor">522</a>, which
is six days’ sail from the north of Britain. Some persons
also affirm that this is the case in Mona, which is about 200
miles from Camelodunum<a id="FNanchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor">523</a>, a town of Britain.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_78">CHAP. 78. (76.)—OF THE FIRST DIAL.</h3></div>

<p>Anaximenes the Milesian, the disciple of Anaximander,
of whom I have spoken above<a id="FNanchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor">524</a>, discovered the theory of
shadows and what is called the art of dialling, and he was
the first who exhibited at Lacedæmon the dial which they
call sciothericon<a id="FNanchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor">525</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_79">CHAP. 79. (77.)—OF THE MODE IN WHICH THE DAYS ARE
COMPUTED.</h3></div>

<p>The days have been computed by different people in different
ways. The Babylonians reckoned from one sunrise
to the next; the Athenians from one sunset to the next; the
Umbrians from noon to noon; the multitude, universally,
from light to darkness; the Roman priests and those who
presided over the civil day, also the Egyptians and Hipparchus,
from midnight to midnight<a id="FNanchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor">526</a>. It appears that the interval
from one sunrise to the next is less near the solstices
than near the equinoxes, because the position of the zodiac
is more oblique about its middle part, and more straight
near the solstice<a id="FNanchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor">527</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_80">CHAP. 80. (78.)—OF THE DIFFERENCE OF NATIONS AS DEPENDING
ON THE NATURE OF THE WORLD.</h3></div>

<p>To these circumstances we must add those that are connected
with certain celestial causes. There can be no doubt,
that the Æthiopians are scorched by their vicinity to the
sun’s heat, and they are born, like persons who have been
burned, with the beard and hair frizzled<a id="FNanchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor">528</a>; while, in the
opposite and frozen parts of the earth, there are nations with
white skins and long light hair. The latter are savage
from the inclemency of the climate, while the former are
dull from its variableness<a id="FNanchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor">529</a>. We learn, from the form of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
legs, that in the one, the fluids, like vapour, are forced into
the upper parts of the body, while in the other, being a
gross humour, it is drawn downwards into the lower parts<a id="FNanchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor">530</a>.
In the cold regions savage beasts are produced, and in the
others, various forms of animals, and many kinds of birds<a id="FNanchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor">531</a>.
In both situations the body grows tall, in the one case by
the force of fire, and in the other by the nutritive moisture.</p>

<p>In the middle of the earth there is a salutary mixture of
the two, a tract fruitful in all things, the habits of the body
holding a mean between the two, with a proper tempering
of colours; the manners of the people are gentle, the intellect
clear<a id="FNanchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor">532</a>, the genius fertile and capable of comprehending every
part of nature. They have formed empires, which has never
been done by the remote nations; yet these latter have never
been subjected by the former, being severed from them and
remaining solitary, from the effect produced on them by
their savage nature.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_81">CHAP. 81. (79.)—OF EARTHQUAKES.</h3></div>

<p>According to the doctrine of the Babylonians, earthquakes
and clefts of the earth, and occurrences of this kind, are
supposed to be produced by the influence of the stars,
especially of the three to which they ascribe thunder<a id="FNanchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor">533</a>; and
to be caused by the stars moving with the sun, or being in
conjunction with it, and, more particularly, when they are
in the quartile aspect<a id="FNanchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor">534</a>. If we are to credit the report, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
most admirable and immortal spirit, as it were of a divine
nature, should be ascribed to Anaximander the Milesian,
who, they say, warned the Lacedæmonians to beware of their
city and their houses<a id="FNanchor_535" href="#Footnote_535" class="fnanchor">535</a>. For he predicted that an earthquake
was at hand, when both the whole of their city was destroyed
and a large portion of Mount Taygetus, which projected in
the form of a ship, was broken off, and added farther ruin to
the previous destruction. Another prediction is ascribed to
Pherecydes, the master of Pythagoras, and this was divine;
by a draught of water from a well, he foresaw and predicted
that there would be an earthquake in that place<a id="FNanchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor">536</a>. And if
these things be true, how nearly do these individuals approach
to the Deity, even during their lifetime! But I
leave every one to judge of these matters as he pleases. I
certainly conceive the winds to be the cause of earthquakes;
for the earth never trembles except when the sea is quite
calm, and when the heavens are so tranquil that the birds
cannot maintain their flight, all the air which should support
them being withdrawn<a id="FNanchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor">537</a>; nor does it ever happen until after
great winds, the gust being pent up, as it were, in the
fissures and concealed hollows. For the trembling of the
earth resembles thunder in the clouds; nor does the yawning
of the earth differ from the bursting of the lightning; the
enclosed air struggling and striving to escape<a id="FNanchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor">538</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_82">CHAP. 82. (80.)—OF CLEFTS OF THE EARTH.</h3></div>

<p>The earth is shaken in various ways, and wonderful effects
are produced<a id="FNanchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor">539</a>; in one place the walls of cities being thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
down, and in others swallowed up by a deep cleft<a id="FNanchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor">540</a>; sometimes
great masses of earth are heaped up, and rivers forced
out, sometimes even flame and hot springs<a id="FNanchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor">541</a>, and at others
the course of rivers is turned. A terrible noise precedes
and accompanies the shock<a id="FNanchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor">542</a>; sometimes a murmuring, like
the lowing of cattle, or like human voices, or the clashing of
arms. This depends on the substance which receives the
sound, and the shape of the caverns or crevices through
which it issues; it being more shrill from a narrow opening,
more hoarse from one that is curved, producing a loud reverberation
from hard bodies, a sound like a boiling fluid<a id="FNanchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor">543</a> from
moist substances, fluctuating in stagnant water, and roaring
when forced against solid bodies. There is, therefore, often
the sound without any motion. Nor is it a simple motion,
but one that is tremulous and vibratory. The cleft sometimes
remains, displaying what it has swallowed up; sometimes
concealing it, the mouth being closed and the soil
being brought over it, so that no vestige is left; the city
being, as it were, devoured, and the tract of country engulfed.
Maritime districts are more especially subject to shocks.
Nor are mountainous tracts exempt from them; I have found,
by my inquiries, that the Alps and the Apennines are frequently
shaken. The shocks happen more frequently in the
autumn and in the spring, as is the case also with thunder.
There are seldom shocks in Gaul and in Egypt; in the latter
it depends on the prevalence of summer, in the former, of
winter. They also happen more frequently in the night than
in the day. The greatest shocks are in the morning and the
evening; but they often take place at day-break, and sometimes
at noon. They also take place during eclipses of the
sun and of the moon, because at that time storms are lulled.
They are most frequent when great heat succeeds to showers,
or showers succeed to great heat<a id="FNanchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor">544</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_83">CHAP. 83. (81.)—SIGNS OF AN APPROACHING EARTHQUAKE.</h3></div>

<p>There is no doubt that earthquakes are felt by persons on
shipboard, as they are struck by a sudden motion of the
waves, without these being raised by any gust of wind.
And things that are in the vessels shake as they do in houses,
and give notice by their creaking; also the birds, when they
settle upon the vessels, are not without their alarms. There
is also a sign in the heavens; for, when a shock is near at
hand, either in the daytime or a little after sunset, a cloud
is stretched out in the clear sky, like a long thin line<a id="FNanchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor">545</a>. The
water in wells is also more turbid than usual, and it emits a
disagreeable odour<a id="FNanchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor">546</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_84">CHAP. 84. (82.)—PRESERVATIVES AGAINST FUTURE
EARTHQUAKES.</h3></div>

<p>These same places<a id="FNanchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor">547</a>, however, afford protection, and this is
also the case where there is a number of caverns, for they
give vent to the confined vapour, a circumstance which has
been remarked in certain towns, which have been less shaken
where they have been excavated by many sewers. And, in
the same town, those parts that are excavated<a id="FNanchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor">548</a> are safer than
the other parts, as is understood to be the case at Naples in
Italy, the part of it which is solid being more liable to injury.
Arched buildings are also the most safe, also the angles of
walls, the shocks counteracting each other; walls made of
brick also suffer less from the shocks<a id="FNanchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor">549</a>. There is also a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
difference in the nature of the motions<a id="FNanchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor">550</a>, where various motions
are experienced. It is the safest when it vibrates and
causes a creaking in the building, and where it swells and
rises upwards, and settles with an alternate motion. It is
also harmless when the buildings coming together butt
against each other in opposite directions, for the motions
counteract each other. A movement like the rolling of waves
is dangerous, or when the motion is impelled in one direction.
The tremors cease when the vapour bursts out<a id="FNanchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor">551</a>; but if
they do not soon cease, they continue for forty days; generally,
indeed, for a longer time: some have lasted even for
one or two years.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_85">CHAP. 85. (83.)—PRODIGIES OF THE EARTH WHICH HAVE
OCCURRED ONCE ONLY.</h3></div>

<p>A great prodigy of the earth, which never happened more
than once, I have found mentioned in the books of the Etruscan
ceremonies, as having taken place in the district of Mutina,
during the consulship of Lucius Martius and Sextus Julius<a id="FNanchor_552" href="#Footnote_552" class="fnanchor">552</a>.
Two mountains rushed together, falling upon each other
with a very loud crash, and then receding; while in the daytime
flame and smoke issued from them; a great crowd of
Roman knights, and families of people, and travellers on the
Æmilian way, being spectators of it. All the farm-houses
were thrown down by the shock, and a great number of
animals that were in them were killed; it was in the year
before the Social war; and I am in doubt whether this event
or the civil commotions were more fatal to the territory of
Italy. The prodigy which happened in our own age was no
less wonderful; in the last year of the emperor Nero<a id="FNanchor_553" href="#Footnote_553" class="fnanchor">553</a>, as I
have related in my history of his times<a id="FNanchor_554" href="#Footnote_554" class="fnanchor">554</a>, when certain fields
and olive grounds in the district of Marrucinum, belonging
to Vectius Marcellus, a Roman knight, the steward of Nero,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
changed places with each other<a id="FNanchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor">555</a>, although the public highway
was interposed.</p>

<p>Inundations of the sea take place at the same time with
earthquakes<a id="FNanchor_556" href="#Footnote_556" class="fnanchor">556</a>; the water being impregnated with the same
spirit<a id="FNanchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor">557</a>, and received into the bosom of the earth which
subsides. The greatest earthquake which has occurred in
our memory was in the reign of Tiberius<a id="FNanchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor">558</a>, by which twelve
cities of Asia were laid prostrate in one night. They occurred
the most frequently during the Punic war, when we had
accounts brought to Rome of fifty-seven earthquakes in the
space of a single year. It was during this year<a id="FNanchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor">559</a> that the
Carthaginians and the Romans, who were fighting at the
lake Thrasimenus, were neither of them sensible of a very
great shock during the battle<a id="FNanchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor">560</a>. Nor is it an evil merely
consisting in the danger which is produced by the motion;
it is an equal or a greater evil when it is considered as a
prodigy<a id="FNanchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor">561</a>. The city of Rome never experienced a shock,
which was not the forerunner of some great calamity.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_87">CHAP. 87. (85.)—IN WHAT PLACES THE SEA HAS RECEDED.</h3></div>

<p>The same cause produces an increase of the land; the
vapour, when it cannot burst out forcibly lifting up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
surface<a id="FNanchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor">562</a>. For the land is not merely produced by what is
brought down the rivers, as the islands called Echinades are
formed by the river Achelous, and the greater part of Egypt
by the Nile, where, according to Homer, it was a day and a
night’s journey from the main land to the island of Pharos<a id="FNanchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor">563</a>;
but, in some cases, by the receding of the sea, as, according
to the same author, was the case with the Circæan isles<a id="FNanchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor">564</a>.
The same thing also happened in the harbour of Ambracia,
for a space of 10,000 paces, and was also said to have taken
place for 5000 at the Piræus of Athens<a id="FNanchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor">565</a>, and likewise at
Ephesus, where formerly the sea washed the walls of the
temple of Diana. Indeed, if we may believe Herodotus<a id="FNanchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor">566</a>, the
sea came beyond Memphis, as far as the mountains of Æthiopia,
and also from the plains of Arabia. The sea also surrounded
Ilium and the whole of Teuthrania, and covered the
plain through which the Mæander flows<a id="FNanchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor">567</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_89">CHAP. 89. (87.)—WHAT ISLANDS HAVE BEEN FORMED, AND
AT WHAT PERIODS.</h3></div>

<p>Delos and Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor">569</a>, islands which have now been long
famous, are recorded to have risen up in this way. More
lately there have been some smaller islands formed; Anapha,
which is beyond Melos; Nea, between Lemnos and the
Hellespont; Halone, between Lebedos and Teos; Thera<a id="FNanchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor">570</a> and
Therasia, among the Cyclades, in the fourth year of the
135th Olympiad<a id="FNanchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor">571</a>. And among the same islands, 130 years
afterwards, Hiera, also called Automate<a id="FNanchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor">572</a>, made its appearance;
also Thia, at the distance of two stadia from the
former, 110 years afterwards, in our own times, when M.
Junius Silanus and L. Balbus were consuls, on the 8th of
the ides of July<a id="FNanchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor">573</a>.</p>

<p>(88.) Opposite to us, and near to Italy, among the Æolian
isles, an island emerged from the sea; and likewise one near
Crete, 2500 paces in extent, and with warm springs in it;
another made its appearance in the third year of the 163rd
Olympiad<a id="FNanchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor">574</a>, in the Tuscan gulf, burning with a violent
explosion. There is a tradition too that a great number of
fishes were floating about the spot, and that those who employed
them for food immediately expired. It is said that
the Pithecusan isles rose up, in the same way, in the bay
of Campania, and that, shortly afterwards, the mountain
Epopos, from which flame had suddenly burst forth, was
reduced to the level of the neighbouring plain. In the same
island, it is said, that a town was sunk in the sea; that in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
consequence of another shock, a lake burst out, and that, by
a third, Prochytas was formed into an island, the neighbouring
mountains being rolled away from it.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_90">CHAP 90.—LANDS WHICH HAVE BEEN SEPARATED BY

<p>In the ordinary course of things islands are also formed
by this means. The sea has torn Sicily from Italy<a id="FNanchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor">575</a>, Cyprus
from Syria, Eubœa from Bœotia<a id="FNanchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor">576</a>, Atalante and Macris<a id="FNanchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor">577</a>

the promontory of the Sirens.</p>

<p>Again, islands are taken from the sea and added to the
main land; Antissa<a id="FNanchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor">578</a> to Lesbos, Zephyrium to Halicarnassus,
Æthusa to Myndus, Dromiscus and Perne to Miletus, Narthecusa
to the promontory of Parthenium. Hybanda,
which was formerly an island of Ionia, is now 200 stadia
distant from the sea. Syries is now become a part of
Ephesus, and, in the same neighbourhood, Derasidas and Sophonia
form part of Magnesia; while Epidaurus and Oricum
are no longer islands<a id="FNanchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor">579</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_92">CHAP. 92. (90.)—LANDS WHICH HAVE BEEN TOTALLY

all, if we are to believe Plato<a id="FNanchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor">580</a>, for an immense space where
the Atlantic ocean is now extended. More lately we see
what has been produced by our inland sea; Acarnania has
been overwhelmed by the Ambracian gulf, Achaia by the
Corinthian, Europe and Asia by the Propontis and Pontus.
And besides these, the sea has rent asunder Leucas, Antirrhium,
the Hellespont, and the two Bosphori<a id="FNanchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor">581</a>.</p>

<div class="section">

<p>And not to speak of bays and gulfs, the earth feeds on
itself; it has devoured the very high mountain of Cybotus,
with the town of Curites; also Sipylus in Magnesia<a id="FNanchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor">582</a>, and
formerly, in the same place, a very celebrated city, which
was called Tantalis; also the land belonging to the cities
Galanis and Gamales in Phœnicia, together with the cities
themselves; also Phegium, the most lofty ridge in Æthiopia<a id="FNanchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor">583</a>.

and Antissa, also Elice and Bura<a id="FNanchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor">584</a> in the gulf of Corinth,
traces of which places are visible in the ocean. From the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>

torn off, with many persons on them. In Sicily also
the half of the city of Tyndaris, and all the part of Italy
which is wanting<a id="FNanchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor">585</a>; in like manner it carried off Eleusina in

<p>But let us say no more of earthquakes and of whatever
may be regarded as the sepulchres of cities<a id="FNanchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor">588</a>; let us rather
speak of the wonders of the earth than of the crimes of
nature. But, by Hercules! the history of the heavens themselves
would not be more difficult to relate:—the abundance
of metals, so various, so rich, so prolific, rising up<a id="FNanchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor">589</a> during so
many ages; when, throughout all the world, so much is,
every day, destroyed by fire, by waste, by shipwreck, by
wars, and by frauds; and while so much is consumed by
luxury and by such a number of people:—the figures on
gems, so multiplied in their forms; the variously-coloured
spots on certain stones, and the whiteness of others, excluding
everything except light:—the virtues of medicinal springs,
and the perpetual fires bursting out in so many places, for
so many ages:—the exhalation of deadly vapours, either
emitted from caverns<a id="FNanchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor">590</a>, or from certain unhealthy districts;
some of them fatal to birds alone, as at Soracte, a district
near the city<a id="FNanchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor">591</a>; others to all animals, except to man<a id="FNanchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor">592</a>, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
others are so to man also, as in the country of Sinuessa and
Puteoli. They are generally called vents, and, by some
persons, Charon’s sewers, from their exhaling a deadly
vapour. Also at Amsanctum, in the country of the Hirpini,
at the temple of Mephitis<a id="FNanchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor">593</a>, there is a place which kills all
those who enter it. And the same takes place at Hierapolis in
Asia<a id="FNanchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor">594</a>, where no one can enter with safety, except the priest
of the great Mother of the Gods. In other places there are
prophetic caves, where those who are intoxicated with the
vapour which rises from them predict future events<a id="FNanchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor">595</a>, as at
the most noble of all oracles, Delphi. In which cases, what
mortal is there who can assign any other cause, than the
divine power of nature, which is everywhere diffused, and
thus bursts forth in various places?</p>

<p>There are certain lands which shake when any one passes
over them<a id="FNanchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor">596</a>; as in the territory of the Gabii, not far from the
city of Rome, there are about 200 acres which shake when
cavalry passes over it: the same thing takes place at Reate.</p>

<p>(95.) There are certain islands which are always floating<a id="FNanchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor">597</a>,
as in the territory of the Cæcubum<a id="FNanchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor">598</a>, and of the above-mentioned
Reate, of Mutina, and of Statonia. In the lake of
Vadimonis and the waters of Cutiliæ there is a dark wood,
which is never seen in the same place for a day and a night
together. In Lydia, the islands named Calaminæ are not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
only driven about by the wind, but may be even pushed at
pleasure from place to place, by poles: many citizens saved
themselves by this means in the Mithridatic war. There are
some small islands in the Nymphæus, called the Dancers<a id="FNanchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor">599</a>,
because, when choruses are sung, they are moved by the
motions of those who beat time. In the great Italian lake of
Tarquinii, there are two islands with groves on them, which
are driven about by the wind, so as at one time to exhibit
the figure of a triangle and at another of a circle; but they
never form a square<a id="FNanchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor">600</a>.</p>

been noticed, that at Locris and Crotona, there has never
been a pestilence, nor have they ever suffered from an earthquake;
in Lycia there are always forty calm days before an
earthquake. In the territory of Argyripa the corn which is
sown never springs up. At the altars of Mucius, in the
country of the Veii, and about Tusculum, and in the Cimmerian
Forest, there are places in which things that are
pushed into the ground cannot be pulled out again. The

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_99">CHAP. 99. (97.)—CONCERNING THE CAUSE OF THE FLOWING
AND EBBING OF THE SEA.</h3></div>

<p>Much has been said about the nature of waters; but the
most wonderful circumstance is the alternate flowing and
ebbing of the tides, which exists, indeed, under various forms,
but is caused by the sun and the moon. The tide flows
twice and ebbs twice between each two risings of the moon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
always in the space of twenty-four hours. First, the moon
rising with the stars<a id="FNanchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor">607</a> swells out the tide, and after some time,
having gained the summit of the heavens, she declines from
the meridian and sets, and the tide subsides. Again, after she
has set, and moves in the heavens under the earth, as she
approaches the meridian on the opposite side, the tide flows
in; after which it recedes until she again rises to us. But
the tide of the next day is never at the same time with that of
the preceding; as if the planet was in attendance<a id="FNanchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor">608</a>, greedily
drinking up the sea, and continually rising in a different place
from what she did the day before. The intervals are, however,
equal, being always of six hours; not indeed in respect of any
particular day or night or place<a id="FNanchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor">609</a>, but equinoctial hours, and
therefore they are unequal as estimated by the length of common
hours, since a greater number of them<a id="FNanchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor">610</a> fall on some certain
days or nights, and they are never equal everywhere
except at the equinox. This is a great, most clear, and even
divine proof of the dullness of those, who deny that the stars
go below the earth and rise up again, and that nature presents
the same face in the same states of their rising and
setting<a id="FNanchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor">611</a>; for the course of the stars is equally obvious in the
one case as in the other, producing the same effect as when
it is manifest to the sight.</p>

<p>There is a difference in the tides, depending on the moon,
of a complicated nature, and, first, as to the period of seven
days. For the tides are of moderate height from the new
moon to the first quarter; from this time they increase, and
are the highest at the full: they then decrease. On the
seventh day they are equal to what they were at the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
quarter, and they again increase from the time that she is at
first quarter on the other side. At her conjunction with
the sun they are equally high as at the full. When the
moon is in the northern hemisphere, and recedes further
from the earth, the tides are lower than when, going towards
the south, she exercises her influence at a less distance<a id="FNanchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor">612</a>.
After an interval of eight years, and the hundredth revolution
of the moon, the periods and the heights of the tides
return into the same order as at first, this planet always
acting upon them; and all these effects are likewise increased
by the annual changes of the sun<a id="FNanchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor">613</a>, the tides rising
up higher at the equinoxes, and more so at the autumnal
than at the vernal; while they are lower<a id="FNanchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor">614</a> about the winter
solstice, and still more so at the summer solstice; not
indeed precisely at the points of time which I have mentioned,
but a few days after<a id="FNanchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor">615</a>; for example, not exactly at
the full nor at the new moon, but after them; and not
immediately when the moon becomes visible or invisible, or
has advanced to the middle of her course, but generally
about two hours later than the equinoctial hours<a id="FNanchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor">616</a>; the effect
of what is going on in the heavens being felt after a short
interval; as we observe with respect to lightning, thunder,
and thunderbolts.</p>

<p>But the tides of the ocean cover greater spaces and produce
greater inundations than the tides of the other seas; whether
it be that the whole of the universe taken together is more
full of life than its individual parts, or that the large open
space feels more sensibly the power of the planet, as it moves
freely about, than when restrained within narrow bounds.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
On which account neither lakes nor rivers are moved in the
same manner. Pytheas<a id="FNanchor_617" href="#Footnote_617" class="fnanchor">617</a> of Massilia informs us, that in
Britain the tide rises 80 cubits<a id="FNanchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor">618</a>. Inland seas are enclosed
as in a harbour, but, in some parts of them, there is a more
free space which obeys the influence<a id="FNanchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor">619</a>. Among many other
examples, the force of the tide will carry us in three days
from Italy to Utica, when the sea is tranquil and there is no
impulse from the sails<a id="FNanchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor">620</a>. But these motions are more felt
about the shores than in the deep parts of the seas, as in the
body the extremities of the veins feel the pulse, which is the
vital spirit, more than the other parts<a id="FNanchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor">621</a>. And in most estuaries,
on account of the unequal rising of the stars in each
tract, the tides differ from each other, but this respects the
period, not the nature of them; as is the case in the Syrtes.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_100">CHAP. 100.—WHERE THE TIDES RISE AND FALL IN AN
UNUSUAL MANNER.</h3></div>

<p>There are, however, some tides which are of a peculiar
nature, as in the Tauromenian Euripus<a id="FNanchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor">622</a>, where the ebb and
flow is more frequent than in other places, and in Eubœa,
where it takes place seven times during the day and the
night. The tides intermit three times during each month,
being the 7th, 8th and 9th day of the moon<a id="FNanchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor">623</a>. At Gades,
which is very near the temple of Hercules, there is a spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
enclosed like a well, which sometimes rises and falls with the
ocean, and, at other times, in both respects contrary to it.
In the same place there is another well, which always agrees
with the ocean. On the shores of the Bætis<a id="FNanchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor">624</a>, there is a town
where the wells become lower when the tide rises, and fill
again when it ebbs; while at other times they remain stationary.
The same thing occurs in one well in the town of
Hispalis<a id="FNanchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor">625</a>, while there is nothing peculiar in the other wells.
The Euxine always flows into the Propontis, the water
never flowing back into the Euxine<a id="FNanchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor">626</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_101">CHAP. 101. (98.)—WONDERS OF THE SEA.</h3></div>

<p>All seas are purified at the full moon<a id="FNanchor_627" href="#Footnote_627" class="fnanchor">627</a>; some also at stated
periods. At Messina and Mylæ a refuse matter, like dung<a id="FNanchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor">628</a>,
is cast up on the shore, whence originated the story of the
oxen of the Sun having had their stable at that place. To
what has been said above (not to omit anything with which
I am acquainted) Aristotle adds, that no animal dies except
when the tide is ebbing. The observation has been often
made on the ocean of Gaul; but it has only been found true
with respect to man<a id="FNanchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor">629</a>.</p>

<p>Hence we may certainly conjecture, that the moon is not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
unjustly regarded as the star of our life<a id="FNanchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor">630</a>. This it is that
replenishes the earth<a id="FNanchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor">631</a>; when she approaches it, she fills all
bodies, while, when she recedes, she empties them. From
this cause it is that shell-fish grow with her increase<a id="FNanchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor">632</a>, and
that those animals which are without blood more particularly
experience her influence; also, that the blood of man is
increased or diminished in proportion to the quantity of her
light; also that the leaves and vegetables generally, as I shall
describe in the proper place<a id="FNanchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor">633</a>, feel her influence, her power
penetrating all things.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_103">CHAP. 103. (100.)—THE POWER OF THE SUN.</h3></div>

<p>Fluids are dried up by the heat of the sun; we have
therefore regarded it as a masculine star, burning up and
absorbing everything<a id="FNanchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor">634</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_104">CHAP. 104.—WHY THE SEA IS SALT.</h3></div>

<p>Hence it is that the widely-diffused sea is impregnated
with the flavour of salt, in consequence of what is sweet and
mild being evaporated from it, which the force of fire easily
accomplishes; while all the more acrid and thick matter is
left behind; on which account the water of the sea is less
salt at some depth than at the surface. And this is a more
true cause of the acrid flavour, than that the sea is the continued
perspiration of the land<a id="FNanchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor">635</a>, or that the greater part of
the dry vapour is mixed with it, or that the nature of the
earth is such that it impregnates the waters, and, as it were,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
medicates them<a id="FNanchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor">636</a>. Among the prodigies which have occurred,
there is one which happened when Dionysius, the tyrant of
Sicily, was expelled from his kingdom; that, for the space
of one day, the water in the harbour became sweet.</p>

<p>(101.) The moon, on the contrary, is said to be a feminine
and delicate planet, and also nocturnal; also that it resolves
humours and draws them out, but does not carry them off.
It is manifest that the carcases of wild beasts are rendered
putrid by its beams, that, during sleep, it draws up the
accumulated torpor into the head, that it melts ice, and
relaxes all things by its moistening spirit<a id="FNanchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor">637</a>. Thus the
changes of nature compensate each other, and are always
adequate to their destined purpose; some of them congealing
the elements of the stars and others dissolving them. The
moon is said to be fed by fresh, and the sun by salt water.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_105">CHAP. 105. (102.)—WHERE THE SEA IS THE DEEPEST.</h3></div>

<p>Fabianus<a id="FNanchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor">638</a> informs us that the greatest depth of the sea is
15 stadia<a id="FNanchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor">639</a>. We learn from others, that in the Euxine,
opposite to the nation of the Coraxi, at what is called the
Depths of the Euxine<a id="FNanchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor">640</a>, about 300 stadia<a id="FNanchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor">641</a> from the main land,
the sea is immensely deep, no bottom having been found.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_106">CHAP. 106. (103.)—THE WONDERS OF FOUNTAINS AND
RIVERS.</h3></div>

<p>It is very remarkable that fresh water should burst out
close to the sea, as from pipes. But there is no end to the
wonders that are connected with the nature of waters. Fresh
water floats on sea water, no doubt from its being lighter;
and therefore sea water, which is of a heavier nature<a id="FNanchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor">642</a>, supports
better what floats upon it. And, in some places,
different kinds of fresh water float upon each other; as that
of the river which falls into the Fucinus; that of the Addua
into the Larius; of the Ticinus into the Verbanus; of the
Mincius into the Benacus; of the Ollius into the Sevinus;
and of the Rhone into the Leman lake<a id="FNanchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor">643</a> (this last being
beyond the Alps, the others in Italy): all which rivers passing
through the lakes for many miles, generally carry off no more
water than they bring with them. The same thing is said to
occur in the Orontes, a river of Syria, and in many others.</p>

<p>Some rivers, from a real hatred of the sea, pass under it,
as does Arethusa, a fountain of Syracuse, in which the substances
are found that are thrown into the Alpheus; which,
after flowing by Olympia, is discharged into the sea, on the
shore of the Peloponnesus<a id="FNanchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor">644</a>. The Lycus in Asia<a id="FNanchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor">645</a>, the Erasinus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
in Argolis, and the Tigris<a id="FNanchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor">646</a> in Mesopotamia, sink into the
earth and burst out again. Substances which are thrown
into the fountain of Æsculapius at Athens<a id="FNanchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor">647</a> are cast up at
the fountain of Phalerum. The river which sinks into the
ground in the plain of Atinum<a id="FNanchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor">648</a> comes up again at the
distance of twenty miles, and the Timavus does the same
in Aquileia<a id="FNanchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor">649</a>.</p>

<p>In the lake Asphaltites, in Judæa, which produces bitumen,
no substance will sink, nor in the lake Arethusa<a id="FNanchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor">650</a>, in the
Greater Armenia: in this lake, although it contains nitre,
fish are found. In the country of the Salentini, near the
town of Manduria, there is a lake<a id="FNanchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor">651</a> full to the brim, the
waters of which are never diminished by what is taken out
of it, nor increased by what is added. Wood, which is
thrown into the river of the Cicones<a id="FNanchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor">652</a>, or into the lake Velinus
in Picenum, becomes coated with a stony crust, while in the
Surius, a river of Colchis, the whole substance becomes as
hard as stone. In the same manner, in the Silarus<a id="FNanchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor">653</a>, beyond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
Surrentum, not only twigs which are immersed in it, but
likewise leaves are petrified; the water at the same time
being proper for drinking. In the stream which runs from
the marsh of Reate<a id="FNanchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor">654</a> there is a rock, which continues to
increase in size, and in the Red Sea olive-trees and green
shrubs are produced<a id="FNanchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor">655</a>.</p>

<p>There are many springs which are remarkable for their
warmth. This is the case even among the ridges of the
Alps<a id="FNanchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor">656</a>, and in the sea itself, between Italy and Ænaria, as in
the bay of Baiæ, and in the Liris and many other rivers<a id="FNanchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor">657</a>.
There are many places in which fresh water may be procured
from the sea, as at the Chelidonian Isles, and at Arados, and
in the ocean at Gades. Green plants are produced in the
warm springs of Padua, frogs in those of Pisa, and fish in
those of Vetulonia in Etruria, which is not far from the sea.
In Casinas there is a cold river called Scatebra, which in summer
is more full of water<a id="FNanchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor">658</a>. In this, as in the river Stymphalis,
in Arcadia, small water-mice are produced. The fountain
of Jupiter in Dodona, although it is as cold as ice, and
extinguishes torches that are plunged into it, yet, if they be
brought near it, it kindles them again<a id="FNanchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor">659</a>. This spring always
becomes dry at noon, from which circumstance it is called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἀναπαυόμενον</span><a id="FNanchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor">660</a>: it then increases and becomes full at midnight,
after which it again visibly decreases. In Illyricum
there is a cold spring, over which if garments are spread
they take fire. The pool of Jupiter Ammon, which is cold
during the day, is warm during the night<a id="FNanchor_661" href="#Footnote_661" class="fnanchor">661</a>. In the country
of the Troglodytæ<a id="FNanchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor">662</a>, what they call the Fountain of the Sun,
about noon is fresh and very cold; it then gradually grows
warm, and, at midnight, becomes hot and saline<a id="FNanchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor">663</a>.</p>

<p>In the middle of the day, during summer, the source of
the Po, as if reposing itself, is always dry<a id="FNanchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor">664</a>. In the island
of Tenedos there is a spring, which, after the summer solstice,
is full of water, from the third hour of the night to
the sixth<a id="FNanchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor">665</a>. The fountain Inopus, in the island of Delos,
decreases and increases in the same manner as the Nile,
and also at the same periods<a id="FNanchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor">666</a>. There is a small island in
the sea, opposite to the river Timavus, containing warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
springs, which increase and decrease at the same time with
the tides of the sea<a id="FNanchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor">667</a>. In the territory of Pitinum, on the
other side of the Apennines, the river Novanus, which
during the solstice is quite a torrent, is dry in the winter<a id="FNanchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor">668</a>.</p>

<p>In Faliscum, all the water which the oxen drink turns
them white; in Bœotia, the river Melas turns the sheep
black; the Cephissus, which flows out of a lake of the same
name, turns them white<a id="FNanchor_669" href="#Footnote_669" class="fnanchor">669</a>; again, the Peneus turns them
black, and the Xanthus, near Ilium, makes them red, whence
the river derives its name<a id="FNanchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor">670</a>. In Pontus, the river Astaces
waters certain plains, where the mares give black milk, which
the people use in diet. In Reate there is a spring called
Neminia, which rises up sometimes in one place and sometimes
in another, and in this way indicates a change in the produce
of the earth<a id="FNanchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor">671</a>. There is a spring in the harbour of Brundisium
that yields water which never becomes putrid at sea. The
water of the Lyncestis, which is said to be acidulous, intoxicates
like wine<a id="FNanchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor">672</a>; this is the case also in Paphlagonia<a id="FNanchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor">673</a> and in
the territory of Calenum<a id="FNanchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor">674</a>. In the island of Andros, at the
temple of Father Bacchus, we are assured by Mucianus,
who was thrice consul, that there is a spring, which, on the
nones of January, always has the flavour of wine; it is called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Διὸς Θεοδοσία</span><a id="FNanchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor">675</a>. Near Nonacris, in Arcadia, the Styx<a id="FNanchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor">676</a>, which
is not unlike it either in odour or in colour, instantly destroys
those who drink it. Also in Librosus, a hill in the
country of the Tauri, there are three springs which inevitably
produce death, but without pain. In the territory
of the Carrinenses in Spain<a id="FNanchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor">677</a>, two springs burst out close
together, the one of which absorbs everything, the other
throws them out. In the same country there is another
spring, which gives to all the fish the appearance of gold,
although, when out of the water, they do not differ in any
respect from other fish. In the territory of Como, near the
Larian lake, there is a copious spring, which always swells
up and subsides again every hour<a id="FNanchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor">678</a>. In the island of Cydonea<a id="FNanchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor">679</a>,
before Lesbos, there is a warm fountain, which flows
only during the spring season. The lake Sinnaus<a id="FNanchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor">680</a>, in Asia,
is impregnated with wormwood, which grows about it. At
Colophon, in the cave of the Clarian Apollo, there is a pool,
by the drinking of which a power is acquired of uttering
wonderful oracles; but the lives of those who drink of it are
shortened<a id="FNanchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor">681</a>. In our own times, during the last years of
Nero’s life, we have seen rivers flowing backwards, as I have
stated in my history of his times<a id="FNanchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor">682</a>.</p>

<p>And indeed who can be mistaken as to the fact, that all
springs are colder in summer than in winter<a id="FNanchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor">683</a>, as well as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
these other wonderful operations of nature; that copper and
lead sink when in a mass, but float when spread out<a id="FNanchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor">684</a>; and
of things that are equally heavy, some will sink to the bottom,
while others will remain on the surface<a id="FNanchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor">685</a>; that heavy
bodies are more easily moved in water<a id="FNanchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor">686</a>; that a stone from
Scyros, although very large, will float, while the same, when
broken into small pieces, sinks<a id="FNanchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor">687</a>; that the body of an animal,
newly deprived of life, sinks, but that, when it is swelled
out, it floats<a id="FNanchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor">688</a>; that empty vessels are drawn out of the water
with no more ease than those that are full<a id="FNanchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor">689</a>; that rain-water
is more useful for salt-pits than other kinds of water<a id="FNanchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor">690</a>;
that salt cannot be made, unless it is mixed with fresh water<a id="FNanchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor">691</a>;
that salt water freezes with more difficulty<a id="FNanchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor">692</a>, and is more readily
heated<a id="FNanchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor">693</a>; that the sea is warmer in winter<a id="FNanchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor">694</a> and more salt in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
the autumn<a id="FNanchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor">695</a>; that everything is soothed by oil, and that
this is the reason why divers send out small quantities of it
from their mouths, because it smoothes any part which is
rough<a id="FNanchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor">696</a> and transmits the light to them; that snow never
falls in the deep part of the sea<a id="FNanchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor">697</a>; that although water generally
has a tendency downwards, fountains rise up<a id="FNanchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor">698</a>, and that
this is the case even at the foot of Ætna<a id="FNanchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor">699</a>, burning as it does,
so as to force out the sand like a ball of flame to the distance
of 150 miles?</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_107">CHAP. 107.—THE WONDERS OF FIRE AND WATER UNITED.</h3></div>

<p>And now I must give an account of some of the wonders

produced by means of water.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_108">CHAP. 108. (104.)—OF MALTHA.</h3></div>

<p>In Samosata, a city of Commagene<a id="FNanchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor">700</a>, there is a pool which
discharges an inflammable mud, called Maltha<a id="FNanchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor">701</a>. It adheres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
to every solid body which it touches, and moreover, when
touched, it follows you, if you attempt to escape from it.
By means of it the people defended their walls against
Lucullus, and the soldiers were burned in their armour<a id="FNanchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor">702</a>. It
is even set on fire in water. We learn by experience that
it can be extinguished only by earth.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_109">CHAP. 109. (105.)—OF NAPHTHA.</h3></div>

<p>Naphtha is a substance of a similar nature<a id="FNanchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor">703</a> (it is so called
about Babylon, and in the territory of the Astaceni, in
Parthia<a id="FNanchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor">704</a>), flowing like liquid bitumen. It has a great affinity
to fire, which instantly darts on it wherever it is seen<a id="FNanchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor">705</a>.
It is said, that in this way it was that Medea burned Jason’s
mistress; her crown having taken fire, when she approached
the altar for the purpose of sacrificing<a id="FNanchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor">706</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_110">CHAP. 110. (106.)—PLACES WHICH ARE ALWAYS BURNING.</h3></div>

<p>Among the wonders of mountains there is Ætna, which
always burns in the night<a id="FNanchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor">707</a>, and for so long a period has
always had materials for combustion, being in the winter
buried in snow, and having the ashes which it has ejected
covered with frost. Nor is it in this mountain alone that
nature rages, threatening to consume the earth<a id="FNanchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor">708</a>; in Phaselis,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
the mountain Chimæra burns, and indeed with a continual
flame, day and night<a id="FNanchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor">709</a>. Ctesias of Cnidos informs us,
that this fire is kindled by water, while it is extinguished
by earth and by hay<a id="FNanchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor">710</a>. In the same country of Lycia, the
mountains of Hephæstius, when touched with a flaming
torch<a id="FNanchor_711" href="#Footnote_711" class="fnanchor">711</a>, burn so violently, that even the stones in the river
and the sand burn, while actually in the water: this fire is
also increased by rain. If a person makes furrows in the
ground with a stick which has been kindled at this fire, it
is said that a stream of flame will follow it. The summit of
Cophantus, in Bactria<a id="FNanchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor">712</a>, burns during the night; and this is
the case in Media and at Sittacene<a id="FNanchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor">713</a>, on the borders of Persia;
likewise in Susa, at the White Tower, from fifteen apertures<a id="FNanchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor">714</a>,
the greatest of which also burns in the daytime.
The plain of Babylon throws up flame from a place like a fish-pond<a id="FNanchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor">715</a>,
an acre in extent. Near Hesperium, a mountain of
the Æthiopians<a id="FNanchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor">716</a>, the fields shine in the night-time like stars;
the same thing takes place in the territory of the Megalopolitani.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
This fire, however, is internal<a id="FNanchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor">717</a>, mild, and not burning
the foliage of a dense wood which is over it<a id="FNanchor_718" href="#Footnote_718" class="fnanchor">718</a>. There is
also the crater of Nymphæum<a id="FNanchor_719" href="#Footnote_719" class="fnanchor">719</a>, which is always burning, in
the neighbourhood of a cold fountain, and which, according
to Theopompus, presages direful calamities to the inhabitants
of Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_720" href="#Footnote_720" class="fnanchor">720</a>. It is increased by rain<a id="FNanchor_721" href="#Footnote_721" class="fnanchor">721</a>, and it throws out
bitumen, which, becoming mixed with the fountain, renders
it unfit to be tasted; it is, at other times, the weakest of all
the bitumens. But what are these compared to other
wonders? Hiera, one of the Æolian isles, in the middle of
the sea, near Italy, together with the sea itself, during the
Social war, burned for several days<a id="FNanchor_722" href="#Footnote_722" class="fnanchor">722</a>, until expiation was
made, by a deputation from the senate. There is a hill in
Æthiopia called <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Θεῶν ὄχημα</span><a id="FNanchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor">723</a>, which burns with the greatest
violence, throwing out flame that consumes everything, like
the sun<a id="FNanchor_724" href="#Footnote_724" class="fnanchor">724</a>. In so many places, and with so many fires, does
nature burn the earth!</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_111">CHAP. 111. (107.)—WONDERS OF FIRE ALONE.</h3></div>

<p>But since this one element is of so prolific a nature as to
produce itself, and to increase from the smallest spark, what
must we suppose will be the effect of all those funeral piles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
of the earth<a id="FNanchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor">725</a>? What must be the nature of that thing,
which, in all parts of the world, supplies this most greedy
voracity without destroying itself? To these fires must be
added those innumerable stars and the great sun itself. There
are also the fires made by men<a id="FNanchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor">726</a>, those which are innate in
certain kinds of stones, those produced by the friction of
wood<a id="FNanchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor">727</a>, and those in the clouds, which give rise to lightning.
It really exceeds all other wonders, that one single day
should pass in which everything is not consumed, especially
when we reflect, that concave mirrors placed opposite to the
sun’s rays produce flame more readily than any other kind of
fire; and that numerous small but natural fires abound everywhere.
In Nymphæum there issues from a rock a fire which
is kindled by rain; it also issues from the waters of the Scantia<a id="FNanchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor">728</a>.
This indeed is a feeble flame, since it passes off, remaining
only a short time on any body to which it is applied:
an ash tree, which overshadows this fiery spring, remains
always green<a id="FNanchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor">729</a>. In the territory of Mutina fire issues from
the ground on the days that are consecrated to Vulcan<a id="FNanchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor">730</a>.
It is stated by some authors, that if a burning body falls
on the fields below Aricia<a id="FNanchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor">731</a>, the ground is set on fire; and
that the stones in the territory of the Sabines and of the
Sidicini<a id="FNanchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor">732</a>, if they be oiled, burn with flame. In Egnatia<a id="FNanchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor">733</a>, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
town of Salentinum, there is a sacred stone, upon which, when
wood is placed, flame immediately bursts forth. In the altar
of Juno Lacinia<a id="FNanchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor">734</a>, which is in the open air, the ashes remain
unmoved, although the winds may be blowing from all
quarters.</p>

<p>It appears also that there are sudden fires both in waters
and even in the human body; that the whole of Lake Thrasymenus
was on fire<a id="FNanchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor">735</a>; that when Servius Tullius, while a child,
was sleeping, flame darted out from his head<a id="FNanchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor">736</a>; and Valerius
Antias informs us, that the same flame appeared about L.
Marcius, when he was pronouncing the funeral oration over
the Scipios, who were killed in Spain; and exhorting the
soldiers to avenge their death. I shall presently mention
more facts of this nature, and in a more distinct manner; in
this place these wonders are mixed up with other subjects.
But my mind, having carried me beyond the mere interpretation
of nature, is anxious to lead, as it were by the hand,
the thoughts of my readers over the whole globe.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_II_CHAP_112">CHAP. 112. (108.)—THE DIMENSIONS OF THE EARTH.</h3></div>

<p>Our part of the earth, of which I propose to give an account,
floating as it were in the ocean which surrounds it
(as I have mentioned above<a id="FNanchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor">737</a>), stretches out to the greatest
extent from east to west, viz. from India to the Pillars consecrated
to Hercules at Gades, being a distance of 8568
miles<a id="FNanchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor">738</a>, according to the statement of Artemidorus<a id="FNanchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor">739</a>, or according<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
to that of Isidorus<a id="FNanchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor">740</a>, 9818 miles. Artemidorus adds
to this 491 miles, from Gades, going round by the Sacred
Promontory, to the promontory of Artabrum<a id="FNanchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor">741</a>, which is the
most projecting part of Spain.</p>

<p>This measurement may be taken in two directions. From
the Ganges, at its mouth, where it discharges itself into the
Eastern ocean, passing through India and Parthyene, to
Myriandrus<a id="FNanchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor">742</a>, a city of Syria, in the bay of Issus, is a distance
of 5215 miles<a id="FNanchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor">743</a>. Thence, going directly by sea, by the
island of Cyprus, Patara in Lycia, Rhodes, and Astypalæa,
islands in the Carpathian sea, by Tænarum in Laconia,
Lilybæum in Sicily and Calaris in Sardinia, is 2103 miles.
Thence to Glades is 1250 miles, making the whole distance
from the Eastern ocean 8568 miles<a id="FNanchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor">744</a>.</p>

<p>The other way, which is more certain, is chiefly by land.
From the Ganges to the Euphrates is 5169 miles; thence to
Mazaca, a town in Cappadocia, is 319 miles; thence, through
Phrygia and Caria, to Ephesus is 415 miles; from Ephesus,
across the Ægean sea to Delos, is 200 miles; to the Isthmus
is 212<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> miles; thence, first by land and afterwards by the
sea of Lechæum and the gulf of Corinth, to Patræ in Peloponnesus,
90 miles; to the promontory of Leucate 87<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> miles;
as much more to Corcyra; to the Acroceraunian mountains
132<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, to Brundisium 87<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, and to Rome 360 miles. To the
Alps, at the village of Scingomagum<a id="FNanchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor">745</a>, is 519 miles; through
Gaul to Illiberis at the Pyrenees, 927; to the ocean and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
coast of Spain, 331 miles; across the passage of Gades 7<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>
miles; which distances, according to the estimate of Artemidorus,
make altogether 8945 miles.</p>

<p>The breadth of the earth, from south to north, is commonly
supposed to be about one-half only of its length, viz. 4490
miles; hence it is evident how much the heat has stolen from
it on one side and the cold on the other: for I do not suppose
that the land is actually wanting, or that the earth has
not the form of a globe; but that, on each side, the uninhabitable
parts have not been discovered. This measure
then extends from the coast of the Æthiopian ocean, the
most distant part which is habitable, to Meroë, 1000 miles<a id="FNanchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor">746</a>;
thence to Alexandria 1250; to Rhodes 562; to Cnidos 87<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>;
to Cos 25; to Samos 100; to Chios 94; to Mitylene 65; to
Tenedos 44; to the promontory of Sigæum 12<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>; to the entrance
of the Euxine 312<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>; to the promontory of Carambis
350; to the entrance of the Palus Mæotis 312<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>; and to the
mouth of the Tanais 275 miles, which distance, if we went
by sea, might be shortened 89 miles. Beyond the Tanais
the most diligent authors have not been able to obtain any
accurate measurement. Artemidorus supposes that everything
beyond is undiscovered, since he confesses that, about
the Tanais, the tribes of the Sarmatæ dwell, who extend
towards the north pole. Isidorus adds 1250 miles, as the
distance to Thule<a id="FNanchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor">747</a>; but this is mere conjecture. For my
part, I believe that the boundaries of Sarmatia really extend
to as great a distance as that mentioned above: for if it
were not very extensive, how could it contain the innumerable
tribes that are always changing their residence? And
indeed I consider the uninhabitable portion of the world to
be still greater; for it is well known that there are innumerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
islands lying off the coast of Germany<a id="FNanchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor">748</a>, which have
been only lately discovered.</p>

<p>The above is all that I consider worth relating about the
length and the breadth of the earth<a id="FNanchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor">749</a>. But Eratosthenes<a id="FNanchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor">750</a>,
a man who was peculiarly well skilled in all the more subtle
parts of learning, and in this above everything else, and a
person whom I perceive to be approved by every one, has
stated the whole of this circuit to be 252,000 stadia, which,
according to the Roman estimate, makes 31,500 miles. The
attempt is presumptuous, but it is supported by such subtle
arguments that we cannot refuse our assent. Hipparchus<a id="FNanchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor">751</a>,
whom we must admire, both for the ability with which he
controverts Eratosthenes, as well as for his diligence in everything
else, has added to the above number not much less
than 25,000 stadia.</p>

<p>(109.) Dionysodorus is certainly less worthy of confidence<a id="FNanchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor">752</a>;
but I cannot omit this most remarkable instance of
Grecian vanity. He was a native of Melos, and was celebrated
for his knowledge of geometry; he died of old age in
his native country. His female relations, who inherited his
property, attended his funeral, and when they had for several
successive days performed the usual rites, they are said to
have found in his tomb an epistle written in his own name
to those left above; it stated that he had descended from
his tomb to the lowest part of the earth, and that it was a
distance of 42,000 stadia. There were not wanting certain
geometricians, who interpreted this epistle as if it had been
sent from the middle of the globe, the point which is at the
greatest distance from the surface, and which must necessarily
be the centre of the sphere. Hence the estimate has been
made that it is 252,000 stadia in circumference.</p>

<p>That harmonical proportion, which compels nature to be
always consistent with itself, obliges us to add to the above
measure, 12,000 stadia; and this makes the earth one
ninety-sixth part of the whole universe.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Thus</span> far have I treated of the position and the wonders of
the earth, of the waters, the stars, and the proportion of
the universe and its dimensions. I shall now proceed to
describe its individual parts; although indeed we may with
reason look upon the task as of an infinite nature, and one
not to be rashly commenced upon without incurring censure.
And yet, on the other hand, there is nothing which ought less
to require an apology, if it is only considered how far from
surprising it is that a mere mortal cannot be acquainted
with everything. I shall therefore not follow any single
author, but shall employ, in relation to each subject, such
writers as I shall look upon as most worthy of credit. For,
indeed, it is the characteristic of nearly all of them, that
they display the greatest care and accuracy in the description
of the countries in which they respectively flourished;
so that by doing this, I shall neither have to blame nor contradict
any one.</p>

<p>The names of the different places will here be simply
given, and as briefly as possible; the account of their celebrity,
and the events which have given rise thereto, being
deferred to a more appropriate occasion; for it must be
remembered that I am here speaking of the earth as a whole,
and I wish to be understood as using the names without any
reference whatever to their celebrity, and as though the
places themselves were in their infancy, and had not as yet
acquired any fame through great events. The name is mentioned,
it is true, but only as forming a part of the world
and the system of the universe.</p>

<p>The whole globe is divided into three parts, Europe, Asia,
and Africa. Our description commences where the sun sets
and at the Straits of Gades<a id="FNanchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor">798</a>, where the Atlantic ocean, bursting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
in, is poured forth into the inland seas. As it makes its
entrance from that side, Africa is on the right hand and
Europe on the left; Asia lies between them<a id="FNanchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor">799</a>; the boundaries
being the rivers Tanais<a id="FNanchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor">800</a> and Nile. The Straits of the ocean,
of which I have just spoken, extend fifteen miles in length and
five<a id="FNanchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor">801</a> in breadth, measured from the village of Mellaria<a id="FNanchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor">802</a> in
Spain to the Album Promontorium<a id="FNanchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor">803</a> or White Promontory in
Africa, as we learn from Turranius Gracilis, who was born in
that vicinity. Titus Livius and Cornelius Nepos however
have stated the breadth, where it is least, to be seven miles,
and where greatest, ten; from so small a mouth as this does
so immense an expanse of water open upon us! Nor is our
astonishment diminished by the fact of its being of great
depth; for, instead of that, there are numerous breakers and
shoals, white with foam, to strike the mariner with alarm.
From this circumstance it is, that many have called this spot
the threshold of The Inland Sea.</p>

<p>At the narrowest part of the Straits, there are mountains
placed to form barriers to the entrance on either side,
Abyla<a id="FNanchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor">804</a> in Africa, and Calpe<a id="FNanchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor">805</a> in Europe, the boundaries
formerly of the labours of Hercules<a id="FNanchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor">806</a>. Hence it is that the
inhabitants have called them the Columns of that god; they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
also believe that they were dug through by him; upon which
the sea, which was before excluded, gained admission, and
so changed the face of nature.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_1">CHAP. 1. (1.)—THE BOUNDARIES AND GULFS OF EUROPE
FIRST SET FORTH IN A GENERAL WAY.</h3></div>

<p>I shall first then speak of Europe, the foster-mother of that
people which has conquered all other nations, and itself by
far the most beauteous portion of the earth. Indeed, many
persons have, not without reason<a id="FNanchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor">807</a>, considered it, not as a
third part only of the earth, but as equal to all the rest,
looking upon the whole of our globe as divided into two
parts only, by a line drawn from the river Tanais to the
Straits of Gades. The ocean, after pouring the waters of the
Atlantic through the inlet which I have here described, and,
in its eager progress, overwhelming all the lands which have
had to dread its approach, skirts with its winding course the
shores of those parts which offer a more effectual resistance,
hollowing out the coast of Europe especially into numerous
bays, among which there are four Gulfs that are more particularly
remarkable. The first of these begins at Calpe, which
I have previously mentioned, the most distant mountain of
Spain; and bends, describing an immense curve, as far as
Locri and the Promontory of Bruttium<a id="FNanchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor">808</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_2">CHAP. 2.—OF SPAIN GENERALLY.</h3></div>

<p>The first land situate upon this Gulf is that which is called
the Farther Spain or Bætica<a id="FNanchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor">809</a>; next to which, beginning at
the frontier town of Urgi<a id="FNanchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor">810</a>, is the Nearer, or Tarraconensian<a id="FNanchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor">811</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
Spain, extending as far as the chain of the Pyrenees. The
Farther Spain is divided lengthwise into two provinces,
Lusitania<a id="FNanchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor">812</a> and Bætica, the former stretching along the
northern side of the latter, and being divided from it by the
river Ana<a id="FNanchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor">813</a>.</p>

<p>The source of this river is in the district of Laminium<a id="FNanchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor">814</a>, in
the Nearer Spain. It first spreads out into a number of
small lakes, and then again contracts itself into a narrow
channel, or entirely disappears under ground<a id="FNanchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor">815</a>, and after
frequently disappearing and again coming to light, finally discharges
itself into the Atlantic Ocean. Tarraconensian Spain
lies on one side, contiguous to the Pyrenees, running downwards
along the sides of that chain, and, stretching across from
the Iberian Sea to the Gallic ocean<a id="FNanchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor">816</a>, is separated from Bætica
and Lusitania by Mount Solorius<a id="FNanchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor">817</a>, the chains of the Oretani<a id="FNanchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor">818</a>
and the Carpetani<a id="FNanchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor">819</a>, and that of the Astures<a id="FNanchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor">820</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_3">CHAP. 3.—OF BÆTICA.</h3></div>

<p>Bætica, so called from the river which divides it in the
middle, excels all the other provinces in the richness of its
cultivation and the peculiar fertility and beauty of its vegetation.</p>

<p>It consists of four jurisdictions, those of Gades<a id="FNanchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor">821</a>, of Corduba<a id="FNanchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor">822</a>,
of Astigi<a id="FNanchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor">823</a>, and of Hispalis<a id="FNanchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor">824</a>. The total number of
its towns is 175; of these nine are colonies<a id="FNanchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor">825</a>, and eight municipal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
towns<a id="FNanchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor">826</a>; twenty-nine have been long since presented with
the old Latin rights<a id="FNanchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor">827</a>; six are free towns<a id="FNanchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor">828</a>, three federate<a id="FNanchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor">829</a>,
and 120 tributary.</p>

<p>In this district, the things that more especially deserve notice,
or are more easily explained in the Latin tongue, are the
following, beginning at the river Ana, along the line of the sea-shore;
the town of Onoba, surnamed Æstuaria<a id="FNanchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor">830</a>; the rivers
Luxia and Urium<a id="FNanchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor">831</a>, flowing through this territory between
the Ana and the Bætis; the Marian<a id="FNanchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor">832</a> Mountains; the river
Bætis; the coast of Corum<a id="FNanchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor">833</a>, with its winding bay; opposite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
to which is Gades, of which we shall have occasion to speak
among the islands<a id="FNanchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor">834</a>. Next comes the Promontory of Juno<a id="FNanchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor">835</a>,
and the port of Bæsippo<a id="FNanchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor">836</a>; the towns of Bœlo<a id="FNanchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor">837</a> and Mellaria<a id="FNanchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor">838</a>,
at which latter begin the Straits of the Atlantic; Carteia<a id="FNanchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor">839</a>,
called by the Greeks Tartessos<a id="FNanchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor">840</a>; and the mountain of Calpe.</p>

<p>Along the coast of the inland sea<a id="FNanchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor">841</a> is the town of Barbesula<a id="FNanchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor">842</a>
with its river; also Salduba<a id="FNanchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor">843</a>; the town of Suel<a id="FNanchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor">844</a>; and then
Malaca<a id="FNanchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor">845</a>, with its river, one of the federate towns. Next to this
comes Mænoba<a id="FNanchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor">846</a>, with its river; then Sexifirmum<a id="FNanchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor">847</a>, surnamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Julium; Selambina<a id="FNanchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor">848</a>; Abdera<a id="FNanchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor">849</a>; and Murci<a id="FNanchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor">850</a>, which is at the
boundary of Bætica. M. Agrippa supposed that all this
coast was peopled by colonists of Punic origin. Beyond the
Anas, and facing the Atlantic, is the country of the Bastuli<a id="FNanchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor">851</a>
and the Turditani. M. Varro informs us, that the Iberians,
the Persians, the Phœnicians, the Celts, and the Carthaginians
spread themselves over the whole of Spain; that the
name “Lusitania” is derived from the games (<em>lusus</em>) of
Father Bacchus, or the fury (<em>lyssa</em><a id="FNanchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor">852</a>) of his frantic attendants,
and that Pan<a id="FNanchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor">853</a> was the governor of the whole of it. But the
traditions respecting Hercules<a id="FNanchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor">854</a> and Pyrene, as well as Saturn,
I conceive to be fabulous in the highest degree.</p>

<p>The Bætis does not rise, as some writers have asserted,
near the town of Mentisa<a id="FNanchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor">855</a>, in the province of Tarraco, but
in the Tugiensian Forest<a id="FNanchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor">856</a>; and near it rises the river Tader<a id="FNanchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor">857</a>,
which waters the territory of Carthage<a id="FNanchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor">858</a>. At Ilorcum<a id="FNanchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor">859</a> it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
turns away from the Funeral Pile<a id="FNanchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor">860</a> of Scipio; then taking a
sweep to the left, it falls into the Atlantic Ocean, giving its
name to this province: at its source it is but small, though
during its course it receives many other streams, which it deprives
as well of their waters as their renown. It first enters
Bætica in Ossigitania<a id="FNanchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor">861</a>, and glides gently, with a smooth
current, past many towns situate on either side of its banks.</p>

<p>Between this river and the sea-shore the most celebrated
places inland are Segida<a id="FNanchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor">862</a>, also surnamed Augurina; Julia<a id="FNanchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor">863</a>,
called Fidentia; Urgao<a id="FNanchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor">864</a> or Alba, Ebora<a id="FNanchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor">865</a> or Cerealis, Iliberri<a id="FNanchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor">866</a>
or Liberini, Ilipula<a id="FNanchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor">867</a> or Laus, Artigi<a id="FNanchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor">868</a> or Julienses,
Vesci<a id="FNanchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor">869</a> or Faventia, Singili<a id="FNanchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor">870</a>, Attegua<a id="FNanchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor">871</a>, Arialdunum, Agla
Minor<a id="FNanchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor">872</a>, Bæbro<a id="FNanchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor">873</a>, Castra Vinaria<a id="FNanchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor">874</a>, Cisimbrium<a id="FNanchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor">875</a>, Hippo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
Nova or New Hippo<a id="FNanchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor">876</a>, Ilurco<a id="FNanchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor">877</a>, Osca<a id="FNanchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor">878</a>, Escua<a id="FNanchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor">879</a>, Sucubo<a id="FNanchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor">880</a>, Nuditanum,
Old Tuati<a id="FNanchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor">881</a>; all which towns are in that part of Bastitania
which extends towards the sea, but in the jurisdiction<a id="FNanchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor">882</a> of
Corduba. In the neighbourhood of the river itself is Ossigi<a id="FNanchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor">883</a>,
also surnamed Laconicum, Iliturgi<a id="FNanchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor">884</a> or Forum Julium, Ipasturgi<a id="FNanchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor">885</a>
or Triumphale, Setia, and, fourteen miles inland,
Obulco<a id="FNanchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor">886</a>, which is also called Pontificense.</p>

<p>Next to these comes Epora<a id="FNanchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor">887</a>, a federate town, Sacili<a id="FNanchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor">888</a>
Martialium, and Onoba<a id="FNanchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor">889</a>. On the right bank is Corduba,
a Roman colony, surnamed Patricia<a id="FNanchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor">890</a>; here the Bætis first
becomes navigable. There are also the towns of Carbula<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
and Detunda<a id="FNanchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor">891</a>, and the river Singulis<a id="FNanchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor">892</a>, which falls into the
Bætis on the same side.</p>

<p>The towns in the jurisdiction of Hispalis are the following:
Celti, Arua<a id="FNanchor_893" href="#Footnote_893" class="fnanchor">893</a>, Canama<a id="FNanchor_894" href="#Footnote_894" class="fnanchor">894</a>, Evia, Ilipa<a id="FNanchor_895" href="#Footnote_895" class="fnanchor">895</a>, surnamed Illa, and Italica<a id="FNanchor_896" href="#Footnote_896" class="fnanchor">896</a>.
On the left of the river is the colony of Hispalis<a id="FNanchor_897" href="#Footnote_897" class="fnanchor">897</a> named
Romuliensis, and, on the opposite side<a id="FNanchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor">898</a>, the town of Osset<a id="FNanchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor">899</a>,
surnamed Julia Constantia, Vergentum, or Julî Genius<a id="FNanchor_900" href="#Footnote_900" class="fnanchor">900</a>,
Orippo, Caura<a id="FNanchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor">901</a>, Siarum, and the river Menoba<a id="FNanchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor">902</a>, which
enters the Bætis on its right bank. Between the æstuaries
of the Bætis lie the towns of Nebrissa<a id="FNanchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor">903</a>, surnamed Veneria,
and of Colobona<a id="FNanchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor">904</a>. The colonies are, Asta<a id="FNanchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor">905</a>, which is also
called Regia, and, more inland, that of Asido<a id="FNanchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor">906</a>, surnamed
Cæsariana.</p>

<p>The river Singulis, discharging itself into the Bætis at the
place already mentioned, washes the colony of Astigi<a id="FNanchor_907" href="#Footnote_907" class="fnanchor">907</a>, surnamed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
Augusta Firma, at which place it becomes navigable.
The other colonies in this jurisdiction which are exempt from
tribute are Tucci, surnamed Augusta Gemella<a id="FNanchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor">908</a>, Itucci called
Virtus Julia<a id="FNanchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor">909</a>, Attubi or Claritas Julia<a id="FNanchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor">910</a>, Urso<a id="FNanchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor">911</a> or Genua Urbanorum;
and among them in former times Munda<a id="FNanchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor">912</a>, which was
taken with the son of Pompey. The free towns are Old Astigi<a id="FNanchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor">913</a>
and Ostippo<a id="FNanchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor">914</a>; the tributary towns are Callet, Callecula,
Castra Gemina, the Lesser Ilipula, Merucra, Sacrana, Obulcula<a id="FNanchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor">915</a>,
and Oningis. As you move away from the sea-coast,
near where the river Menoba is navigable, you find, at no
great distance, the Alontigiceli and the Alostigi<a id="FNanchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor">916</a>.</p>

<p>The country which extends from the Bætis to the river
Anas, beyond the districts already described, is called Bæturia,
and is divided into two parts and the same number of
nations; the Celtici<a id="FNanchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor">917</a>, who border upon Lusitania, in the jurisdiction<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of Hispalis, and the Turduli, who dwell on the
verge<a id="FNanchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor">918</a> of Lusitania and Tarraconensis, and are under the
protection of the laws of Corduba. It is evident that the
Celtici have sprung from the Celtiberi, and have come from
Lusitania, from their religious rites, their language, and the
names of their towns, which in Bætica are distinguished by
the following epithets<a id="FNanchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor">919</a>, which have been given to them.
Seria has received the surname of Fama Julia<a id="FNanchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor">920</a>, Nertobriga
that of Concordia Julia<a id="FNanchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor">921</a>, Segida that of Restituta
Julia<a id="FNanchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor">922</a>, and Contributa<a id="FNanchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor">923</a> that of Julia. What is now Curiga
was formerly Ucultuniacum, Constantia Julia<a id="FNanchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor">924</a> was Laconimurgis,
the present Fortunales were the Tereses<a id="FNanchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor">925</a>, and the
Emanici were the Callenses<a id="FNanchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor">926</a>. Besides these, there are in
Celtica the towns of Acinippo<a id="FNanchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor">927</a>, Arunda<a id="FNanchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor">928</a>, Aruci<a id="FNanchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor">929</a>, Turobriga,
Lastigi, Salpesa, Sæpone, and Serippo.</p>

<p>The other Bæturia, which we have mentioned, is inhabited
by the Turduli, and, in the jurisdiction of Corduba, has some
towns which are by no means inconsiderable; Arsa<a id="FNanchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor">930</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
Mellaria<a id="FNanchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor">931</a>, Mirobriga<a id="FNanchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor">932</a>, and Sisapo<a id="FNanchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor">933</a>, in the district of
Osintias.</p>

<p>To the jurisdiction of Gades belongs Regina, with Roman
citizens; and Læpia, Ulia<a id="FNanchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor">934</a>, Carisa<a id="FNanchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor">935</a> surnamed Aurelia, Urgia<a id="FNanchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor">936</a>
or Castrum Julium, likewise called Cæsaris Salutariensis,
all of which enjoy the Latian rights. The tributary towns
are Besaro, Belippo<a id="FNanchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor">937</a>, Barbesula, Lacippo, Bæsippo, Callet,
Cappacum, Oleastro, Ituci, Brana, Lacibi, Saguntia<a id="FNanchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor">938</a>, and
Audorisæ.</p>

<p>M. Agrippa has also stated the whole length of this province
to be 475 miles<a id="FNanchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor">939</a>, and its breadth 257; but this was at
a time when its boundaries extended to Carthage<a id="FNanchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor">940</a>, a circumstance
which has often caused great errors in calculations;
which are generally the result either of changes effected in the
limits of provinces, or of the fact that in the reckoning of distances
the length of the miles has been arbitrarily increased or
diminished. In some parts too the sea has been long making
encroachments upon the land, and in others again the shores
have advanced; while the course of rivers in this place has
become more serpentine, in that more direct. And then,
besides, some writers begin their measurements at one place,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
and some at another, and so proceed in different directions;
and hence the result is, that no two accounts agree.</p>

<p>(2.) At the present day the length of Bætica, from the
town of Castulo<a id="FNanchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor">941</a>, on its frontier, to Gades is 250 miles, and
from Murci, which lies on the sea-coast, twenty-five miles
more. The breadth, measured from the coast of Carteia, is
234 miles. Who is there that can entertain the belief that
Agrippa, a man of such extraordinary diligence, and one who
bestowed so much care on his subject, when he proposed to
place before the eyes of the world a survey of that world, could
be guilty of such a mistake as this, and that too when seconded
by the late emperor the divine Augustus? For it was that
emperor who completed the Portico<a id="FNanchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor">942</a> which had been begun
by his sister, and in which the survey was to be kept, in conformity
with the plan and descriptions of M. Agrippa.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_4">CHAP. 4. (3.)—OF NEARER SPAIN.</h3></div>

<p>The ancient form of the Nearer Spain, like that of many
other provinces, is somewhat changed, since the time when
Pompey the Great, upon the trophies which he erected in
the Pyrenees, testified that 877 towns, from the Alps to the
borders of the Farther Spain, had been reduced to subjection
by him. The whole province is now divided into seven jurisdictions,
those of Carthage<a id="FNanchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor">943</a>, of Tarraco, of Cæsar Augusta<a id="FNanchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor">944</a>, of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Clunia<a id="FNanchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor">945</a>, of Asturica<a id="FNanchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor">946</a>, of Lucus<a id="FNanchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor">947</a>, and of the Bracari<a id="FNanchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor">948</a>. To these
are to be added the islands, which will be described on
another occasion, as also 293 states which are dependent on
others; besides which the province contains 179 towns. Of
these, twelve are colonies, thirteen, towns with the rights of
Roman citizens, eighteen with the old Latian rights, one
confederate, and 135 tributary.</p>

<p>The first people that we come to on the coast are the
Bastuli; after whom, proceeding according to the order which
I shall follow, as we go inland, there are the Mentesani, the
Oretani, and the Carpetani on the Tagus, and next to
them the Vaccæi, the Vectones, and the Celtiberian Arevaci.
The towns nearest to the coast are Urci, and Barea<a id="FNanchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor">949</a> included
in Bætica, the district of Mavitania, next to it Deitania, and
then Contestania, and the colony of Carthago Nova; from
the Promontory of which, known as the Promontorium Saturni<a id="FNanchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor">950</a>,
to the city of Cæsarea<a id="FNanchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor">951</a> in Mauritania, the passage is
a distance of 187 miles. The remaining objects worthy of
mention on the coast are the river Tader<a id="FNanchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor">952</a>, and the free colony
of Ilici<a id="FNanchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor">953</a>, whence the Ilicitanian Gulf<a id="FNanchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor">954</a> derives its name; to
this colony the Icositani are subordinate.</p>

<p>We next have Lucentum<a id="FNanchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor">955</a>, holding Latian rights; Dianium<a id="FNanchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor">956</a>,
a tributary town; the river Sucro<a id="FNanchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor">957</a>, and in former times a
town of the same name, forming the frontier of Contestania.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
Next is the district of Edetania, with the delightful expanse
of a lake<a id="FNanchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor">958</a> before it, and extending backward to Celtiberia.
Valentia<a id="FNanchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor">959</a>, a colony, is situate three miles from the sea, after
which comes the river Turium<a id="FNanchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor">960</a>, and Saguntum<a id="FNanchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor">961</a> at the same
distance, a town of Roman citizens famous for its fidelity,
the river Uduba<a id="FNanchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor">962</a>, and the district of the Ilergaones<a id="FNanchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor">963</a>. The
Iberus<a id="FNanchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor">964</a>, a river enriched by its commerce, takes its rise in
the country of the Cantabri, not far from the town of Juliobriga<a id="FNanchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor">965</a>,
and flows a distance of 450 miles; 260 of which, from
the town of Varia<a id="FNanchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor">966</a> namely, it is available for the purposes of
navigation. From this river the name of Iberia has been
given by the Greeks to the whole of Spain.</p>

<p>Next comes the district of Cossetania, the river Subi<a id="FNanchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor">967</a>,
and the colony of Tarraco, which was built by the Scipios as
Carthage<a id="FNanchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor">968</a> was by the Carthaginians. Then the district of the
Ilergetes, the town of Subur<a id="FNanchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor">969</a>, and the river Rubricatum<a id="FNanchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor">970</a>,
beyond which begin the Laletani and the Indigetes<a id="FNanchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor">971</a>. Behind
these, in the order in which they will be mentioned,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
going back from the foot of the Pyrenees, are the Ausetani<a id="FNanchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor">972</a>,
the Lacetani<a id="FNanchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor">973</a>, and along the Pyrenees, the Cerretani<a id="FNanchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor">974</a>, next to
whom are the Vascones<a id="FNanchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor">975</a>. On the coast is the colony of
Barcino<a id="FNanchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor">976</a>, surnamed Faventia; Bætulo<a id="FNanchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor">977</a> and Iluro<a id="FNanchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor">978</a>, towns with
Roman citizens; the river Larnum<a id="FNanchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor">979</a>, Blandæ<a id="FNanchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor">980</a>, the river Alba<a id="FNanchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor">981</a>;
Emporiæ<a id="FNanchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor">982</a>, a city consisting of two parts, one peopled by the
original inhabitants, the other by the Greek descendants
of the Phocæans; and the river Ticher<a id="FNanchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor">983</a>. From this to the
Venus Pyrenæa<a id="FNanchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor">984</a>, on the other side of the Promontory, is a
distance of forty miles.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to give an account of the more remarkable
things in these several jurisdictions, in addition to
those which have been already mentioned. Forty-three
different peoples are subject to the jurisdiction of the courts of
Tarraco: of these the most famous are—holding the rights

the tributaries are the Aquicaldenses<a id="FNanchor_990" href="#Footnote_990" class="fnanchor">990</a>, the Onenses, and the
Bæculonenses<a id="FNanchor_991" href="#Footnote_991" class="fnanchor">991</a>.</p>

<p>Cæsar Augusta, a free colony, watered by the river Iberus,
on the site of the town formerly called Salduba, is situate in
the district of Edetania, and is the resort of fifty-five nations.
Of these there are, with the rights of Roman citizens, the
Bellitani<a id="FNanchor_992" href="#Footnote_992" class="fnanchor">992</a>, the Celsenses<a id="FNanchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor">993</a>, a former colony, the Calagurritani<a id="FNanchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor">994</a>,

Surdaones, near whom is the river Sicoris, the Oscenses<a id="FNanchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor">996</a> in
the district of Vescitania, and the Turiasonenses<a id="FNanchor_997" href="#Footnote_997" class="fnanchor">997</a>. Of those

are the Tarragenses<a id="FNanchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor">1002</a>; and of tributaries, the Arcobrigenses<a id="FNanchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor">1003</a>,

<p>Sixty-five different nations resort to Carthage<a id="FNanchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor">1016</a>, besides
the inhabitants of the islands. Of the Accitanian<a id="FNanchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor">1017</a> colony,
there are the Gemellenses, and the town of Libisosona<a id="FNanchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor">1018</a>, surnamed
Foroaugustana, to both of which have been granted
Italian<a id="FNanchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor">1019</a> rights. Of the colony of Salaria<a id="FNanchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor">1020</a>, there are the people
of the following towns, enjoying the rights of ancient Latium:
the Castulonenses, also called the Cæsari Venales, the
Sætabitani<a id="FNanchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor">1021</a> or Augustani, and the Valerienses<a id="FNanchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor">1022</a>. The best
known among the tributaries are the Alabanenses<a id="FNanchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor">1023</a>, the Bastitani<a id="FNanchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor">1024</a>,
the Consaburrenses<a id="FNanchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor">1025</a>, the Dianenses<a id="FNanchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor">1026</a>, the Egelestani<a id="FNanchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor">1027</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
the Ilorcitani<a id="FNanchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor">1028</a>, the Laminitani, the Mentesani<a id="FNanchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor">1029</a>, both those
called Oritani and those called Bastuli, and the Oretani
who are surnamed Germani<a id="FNanchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor">1030</a>, the people of Segobriga<a id="FNanchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor">1031</a> the
capital of Celtiberia, those of Toletum<a id="FNanchor_1032" href="#Footnote_1032" class="fnanchor">1032</a> the capital of Carpetania,
situate on the river Tagus, and after them the Viatienses
and the Virgilienses<a id="FNanchor_1033" href="#Footnote_1033" class="fnanchor">1033</a>.</p>

<p>To the jurisdiction of Clunia<a id="FNanchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor">1034</a> the Varduli contribute fourteen
nations, of whom we need only particularize the Albanenses<a id="FNanchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor">1035</a>,
the Turmodigi<a id="FNanchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor">1036</a>, consisting of four tribes, among
which are the Segisamonenses<a id="FNanchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor">1037</a> and the Segisamaiulienses.
To the same jurisdiction belong the Carietes<a id="FNanchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor">1038</a> and the Vennenses
with five states, among which are the Velienses.
Thither too resort the Pelendones of the Celtiberians, in
four different nations, among whom the Numantini<a id="FNanchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor">1039</a> were
especially famous. Also, among the eighteen states of the
Vaccæi, there are the Intercatienses<a id="FNanchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor">1040</a>, the Pallantini<a id="FNanchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor">1041</a>, the
Lacobrigenses, and the Caucenses<a id="FNanchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor">1042</a>. But among the seven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
peoples belonging to the Cantabri, Juliobriga<a id="FNanchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor">1043</a> is the only
place worthy of mention; and of the ten states of the Autrigones,
Tritium and Virovesca<a id="FNanchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor">1044</a>. The river Areva<a id="FNanchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor">1045</a> gives
its name to the Arevaci; of whom there are six towns, Segontia<a id="FNanchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor">1046</a>
and Uxama<a id="FNanchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor">1047</a>, names which are frequently given to
other places, as also Segovia<a id="FNanchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor">1048</a> and Nova Augusta, Termes<a id="FNanchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor">1049</a>,
and Clunia itself, the frontier of Celtiberia. The remaining
portion turns off towards the ocean, being occupied by the
Varduli, already mentioned, and the Cantabri.</p>

<p>Next upon these touch the twenty-two nations of the
Astures, who are divided into the Augustani<a id="FNanchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor">1050</a> and the Transmontani,
with the magnificent city of Asturica. Among
these we have the Cigurri<a id="FNanchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor">1051</a>, the Pæsici, the Lancienses<a id="FNanchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor">1052</a>, and
the Zoëlæ<a id="FNanchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor">1053</a>. The total number of the free population amounts
to 240,000 persons.</p>

<p>The jurisdiction of Lucus<a id="FNanchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor">1054</a> embraces, besides the Celtici
and the Lebuni, sixteen different nations, but little known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
and with barbarous names. The number however of the free
population amounts to nearly 166,000.</p>

<p>In a similar manner the twenty-four states of the jurisdiction
of the Bracari contain a population of 175,000, among
whom, besides the Bracari<a id="FNanchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor">1055</a> themselves, we may mention,
without wearying the reader, the Bibali, the Cœlerni, the
Gallæci, the Hequæsi, the Limici, and the Querquerni.</p>

<p>The length of the Nearer Spain, from the Pyrenees to the
frontier of Castulo, is 607<a id="FNanchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor">1056</a> miles, and a little more if we follow
the line of the coast; while its breadth, from Tarraco to
the shore of Olarson<a id="FNanchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor">1057</a>, is 307<a id="FNanchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor">1058</a> miles. From the foot of the
Pyrenees, where it is wedged in by the near approach of the
two seas, it gradually expands until it touches the Farther
Spain, and thereby acquires a width more than double<a id="FNanchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor">1059</a>.</p>

<p>Nearly the whole of Spain abounds in mines<a id="FNanchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor">1060</a> of lead, iron,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
copper, silver, and gold; in the Nearer Spain there is also
found lapis specularis<a id="FNanchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor">1061</a>; in Bætica there is cinnabar. There
are also quarries of marble. The Emperor Vespasianus
Augustus, while still harassed by the storms that agitated
the Roman state, conferred the Latian rights on the whole
of Spain. The Pyrenean mountains divide Spain from Gaul,
their extremities projecting into the two seas on either side.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_5">CHAP. 5. (4.)—OF THE PROVINCE OF GALLIA NARBONENSIS.</h3></div>

<p>That part of the Gallias which is washed by the inland sea<a id="FNanchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor">1062</a>
is called the province of [Gallia] Narbonensis<a id="FNanchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor">1063</a>, having
formerly borne the name of Braccata<a id="FNanchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor">1064</a>. It is divided from
Italy by the river Varus<a id="FNanchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor">1065</a>, and by the range of the Alps, the
great safeguards of the Roman Empire. From the remainder
of Gaul, on the north, it is separated by the mountains Cebenna<a id="FNanchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor">1066</a>
and Jura<a id="FNanchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor">1067</a>. In the cultivation of the soil, the manners
and civilization of the inhabitants, and the extent of its
wealth, it is surpassed by none of the provinces, and, in short,
might be more truthfully described as a part of Italy than
as a province. On the coast we have the district of the
Sordones<a id="FNanchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor">1068</a>, and more inland that of the Consuarani<a id="FNanchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor">1069</a>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
rivers are the Tecum and the Vernodubrum<a id="FNanchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor">1070</a>. The towns
are Illiberis<a id="FNanchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor">1071</a>, the scanty remains of what was formerly a great
city, and Ruscino<a id="FNanchor_1072" href="#Footnote_1072" class="fnanchor">1072</a>, a town with Latian rights. We then
come to the river Atax<a id="FNanchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor">1073</a>, which flows from the Pyrenees, and
passes through the Rubrensian Lake<a id="FNanchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor">1074</a>, the town of Narbo
Martius, a colony of the tenth legion, twelve miles distant
from the sea, and the rivers Arauris<a id="FNanchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor">1075</a> and Liria<a id="FNanchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor">1076</a>. The towns
are otherwise but few in number, in consequence of the
numerous lakes<a id="FNanchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor">1077</a> which skirt the sea-shore. We have Agatha<a id="FNanchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor">1078</a>,
formerly belonging to the Massilians, and the district of
the Volcæ Tectosages<a id="FNanchor_1079" href="#Footnote_1079" class="fnanchor">1079</a>; and there is the spot where Rhoda<a id="FNanchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor">1080</a>,
a Rhodian colony, formerly stood, from which the river takes
its name of Rhodanus<a id="FNanchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor">1081</a>; a stream by far the most fertilizing
of any in either of the Gallias. Descending from the Alps
and rushing through lake Lemanus<a id="FNanchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor">1082</a>, it carries along with it
the sluggish Arar<a id="FNanchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor">1083</a>, as well as the torrents of the Isara and
the Druentia<a id="FNanchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor">1084</a>, no less rapid than itself. Its two smaller
mouths are called Libica<a id="FNanchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor">1085</a>, one being the Spanish, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
other the Metapinian mouth; the third and largest is called
the Massiliotic<a id="FNanchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor">1086</a>. There are some authors who state that there
was formerly a town called Heraclea<a id="FNanchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor">1087</a> at the mouth of the
Rhodanus or Rhone.</p>

<p>Beyond this are the Canals<a id="FNanchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor">1088</a> leading out of the Rhone, a
famous work of Caius Marius, and still distinguished by his
name; the Lake of Mastramela<a id="FNanchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor">1089</a>, the town of Maritima<a id="FNanchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor">1090</a> of the
Avatici, and, above this, the Stony Plains<a id="FNanchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor">1091</a>, memorable for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
battles of Hercules; the district of the Anatilii<a id="FNanchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor">1092</a>, and more
inland, that of the Desuviates<a id="FNanchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor">1093</a> and the Cavari. Again, close
upon the sea, there is that of the Tricorii<a id="FNanchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor">1094</a>, and inland, there
are the Tricolli<a id="FNanchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor">1095</a>, the Vocontii<a id="FNanchor_1096" href="#Footnote_1096" class="fnanchor">1096</a>, and the Segovellauni, and,
after them, the Allobroges<a id="FNanchor_1097" href="#Footnote_1097" class="fnanchor">1097</a>.</p>

<p>On the coast is Massilia, a colony of Phocæan<a id="FNanchor_1098" href="#Footnote_1098" class="fnanchor">1098</a> Greeks,
and a federate<a id="FNanchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor">1099</a> city; we then have the Promontory of Zao<a id="FNanchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor">1100</a>,
the port of Citharista<a id="FNanchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor">1101</a>, and the district of the Camatullici<a id="FNanchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor">1102</a>;
then the Suelteri<a id="FNanchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor">1103</a>, and above them the Verrucini<a id="FNanchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor">1104</a>. Again,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
on the coast, we find Athenopolis<a id="FNanchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor">1105</a>, belonging to the Massilians,
Forum Julii<a id="FNanchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor">1106</a> Octavanorum, a colony, which is also
called Pacensis and Classica, the river Argenteus<a id="FNanchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor">1107</a>, which
flows through it, the district of the Oxubii<a id="FNanchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor">1108</a> and that of the Ligauni<a id="FNanchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor">1109</a>;
above whom are the Suetri<a id="FNanchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor">1110</a>, the Quariates<a id="FNanchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor">1111</a> and the
Adunicates<a id="FNanchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor">1112</a>. On the coast we have Antipolis<a id="FNanchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor">1113</a>, a town with
Latian rights, the district of the Deciates, and the river Varus,
which proceeds from Mount Cema, one of the Alps.</p>

<p>The colonies in the interior are Arelate Sextanorum<a id="FNanchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor">1114</a>,
Beterræ Septimanorum<a id="FNanchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor">1115</a>, and Arausio<a id="FNanchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor">1116</a> Secundanorum; Valentia<a id="FNanchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor">1117</a>
in the territory of the Cavari, and Vienna<a id="FNanchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor">1118</a> in that of

capitals of the federate state of the Vocontii. There are also
nineteen towns of less note, as well as twenty-four belonging
to the people of Nemausum. To this list<a id="FNanchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor">1147</a> the Emperor Galba
added two tribes dwelling among the Alps, the Avantici<a id="FNanchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor">1148</a>
and the Bodiontici, to whom belongs the town of Dinia<a id="FNanchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor">1149</a>.
According to Agrippa the length of the province of Gallia
Narbonensis is 370 miles, and its breadth 248<a id="FNanchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor">1150</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_6">CHAP. 6. (5.)—OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>Next comes Italy, and we begin with the Ligures<a id="FNanchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor">1151</a>, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
whom we have Etruria, Umbria, Latium, where the mouths of
the Tiber are situate, and Rome, the Capital of the world,
sixteen miles distant from the sea. We then come to the
coasts of the Volsci and of Campania, and the districts of
Picenum, of Lucania, and of Bruttium, where Italy extends
the farthest in a southerly direction, and projects into the
[two] seas with the chain of the Alps<a id="FNanchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor">1152</a>, which there forms
pretty nearly the shape of a crescent. Leaving Bruttium
we come to the coast of [Magna] Græcia, then the Salentini,
the Pediculi, the Apuli, the Peligni, the Frentani, the Marrucini,
the Vestini, the Sabini, the Picentes, the Galli, the
Umbri, the Tusci, the Veneti, the Carni, the Iapydes, the
Histri, and the Liburni.</p>

<p>I am by no means unaware that I might be justly accused
of ingratitude and indolence, were I to describe thus briefly
and in so cursory a manner the land which is at once the
foster-child<a id="FNanchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor">1153</a> and the parent of all lands; chosen by the providence
of the Gods to render even heaven itself more glorious<a id="FNanchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor">1154</a>,
to unite the scattered empires of the earth, to bestow a
polish upon men’s manners, to unite the discordant and uncouth
dialects of so many different nations by the powerful
ties of one common language, to confer the enjoyments of
discourse and of civilization upon mankind, to become, in
short, the mother-country of all nations of the Earth.</p>

<p>But how shall I commence this undertaking? So vast is
the number of celebrated places (what man living could
enumerate them all?), and so great the renown attached
to each individual nation and subject, that I feel myself quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
at a loss. The city of Rome alone, which forms a portion
of it, a face well worthy of shoulders so beauteous, how
large a work would it require for an appropriate description!
And then too the coast of Campania, taken singly by itself!
so blest with natural beauties and opulence, that it is evident
that when nature formed it she took a delight in accumulating
all her blessings in a single spot—how am I to do justice to
it? And then the climate, with its eternal freshness and so
replete with health and vitality, the sereneness of the weather
so enchanting, the fields so fertile, the hill sides so sunny,
the thickets so free from every danger, the groves so cool and
shady, the forests with a vegetation so varying and so luxuriant,
the breezes descending from so many a mountain, the
fruitfulness of its grain, its vines, and its olives so transcendent;
its flocks with fleeces so noble, its bulls with necks so
sinewy, its lakes recurring in never-ending succession, its
numerous rivers and springs which refresh it with their waters
on every side, its seas so many in number, its havens and the
bosom of its lands opening everywhere to the commerce of
all the world, and as it were eagerly stretching forth into
the very midst of the waves, for the purpose of aiding as it
were the endeavours of mortals!</p>

<p>For the present I forbear to speak of its genius, its manners,
its men, and the nations whom it has conquered by
eloquence and force of arms. The very Greeks themselves,
a race fond in the extreme of expatiating on their own praises,
have amply given judgment in its favour, when they named
but a small part of it ‘Magna Græcia<a id="FNanchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor">1155</a>.’ But we must be
content to do on this occasion as we have done in our description
of the heavens; we must only touch upon some of
these points, and take notice of but a few of its stars. I
only beg my readers to bear in mind that I am thus hastening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
on for the purpose of giving a general description of
everything that is known to exist throughout the whole earth.</p>

<p>I may premise by observing that this land very much resembles
in shape an oak leaf, being much longer than it is
broad; towards the top it inclines to the left<a id="FNanchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor">1156</a>, while it terminates
in the form of an Amazonian buckler<a id="FNanchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor">1157</a>, in which the spot
at the central projection is the place called Cocinthos, while it
sends forth two horns at the end of its crescent-shaped bays,
Leucopetra on the right and Lacinium on the left. It extends
in length 1020 miles, if we measure from the foot of
the Alps at Prætoria Augusta, through the city of Rome and
Capua to the town of Rhegium, which is situate on the
shoulder of the Peninsula, just at the bend of the neck as it
were. The distance would be much greater if measured to
Lacinium, but in that case the line, being drawn obliquely,
would incline too much to one side. Its breadth is variable;
being 410 miles between the two seas, the Lower and the
Upper<a id="FNanchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor">1158</a>, and the rivers Varus and Arsia<a id="FNanchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor">1159</a>: at about the middle,
and in the vicinity of the city of Rome, from the spot where
the river Aternus<a id="FNanchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor">1160</a> flows into the Adriatic sea, to the mouth
of the Tiber, the distance is 136 miles, and a little less from
Castrum-novum on the Adriatic sea to Alsium<a id="FNanchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor">1161</a> on the Tuscan;
but in no place does it exceed 200 miles in breadth.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
The circuit of the whole, from the Varus to the Arsia, is 3059
miles<a id="FNanchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor">1162</a>.</p>

<p>As to its distance from the countries that surround it—Istria
and Liburnia are, in some places<a id="FNanchor_1163" href="#Footnote_1163" class="fnanchor">1163</a>, 100 miles from it,
and Epirus and Illyricum 50; Africa is less than 200, as we
are informed by M. Varro; Sardinia<a id="FNanchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor">1164</a> is 120, Sicily 1<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>, Corsica
less than 80, and Issa<a id="FNanchor_1165" href="#Footnote_1165" class="fnanchor">1165</a> 50. It extends into the two seas
towards the southern parts of the heavens, or, to speak with
more minute exactness, between the sixth<a id="FNanchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor">1166</a> hour and the first
hour of the winter solstice.</p>

<p>We will now describe its extent and its different cities;
in doing which, it is necessary to premise, that we shall follow
the arrangement of the late Emperor Augustus, and
adopt the division which he made of the whole of Italy into
eleven districts; taking them, however, according to their
order on the sea-line, as in so hurried a detail it would not be
possible otherwise to describe each city in juxtaposition with
the others in its vicinity. And for the same reason, in describing
the interior, I shall follow the alphabetical order
which has been adopted by that Emperor, pointing out the
colonies of which he has made mention in his enumeration.
Nor is it a very easy task to trace their situation and origin;
for, not to speak of others, the Ingaunian Ligurians have had
lands granted to them as many as thirty different times.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_7">CHAP. 7.—OF THE NINTH<a id="FNanchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor">1167</a> REGION OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>To begin then with the river Varus; we have the town of
Nicæa<a id="FNanchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor">1168</a>, founded by the Massilians, the river Paulo<a id="FNanchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor">1169</a>, the Alps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
and the Alpine tribes, distinguished by various names<a id="FNanchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor">1170</a>, but
more especially the Capillati<a id="FNanchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor">1171</a>, Cemenelio<a id="FNanchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor">1172</a>, a town of the state
of the Vediantii, the port of Hercules Monæcus<a id="FNanchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor">1173</a>, and the
Ligurian coast. The more celebrated of the Ligurian tribes
beyond the Alps are the Salluvii, the Deciates, and the
Oxubii<a id="FNanchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor">1174</a>; on this side of the Alps, the Veneni<a id="FNanchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor">1175</a>, and the Vagienni,
who are derived from the Caturiges<a id="FNanchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor">1176</a>, the Statielli<a id="FNanchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor">1177</a>,

the Veleiates<a id="FNanchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor">1180</a>, and the peoples whose towns we shall describe
as lying near the adjoining coast. The river Rutuba<a id="FNanchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor">1181</a>, the
town of Albium Intemelium<a id="FNanchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor">1182</a>, the river Merula<a id="FNanchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor">1183</a>, the town

the river Macra<a id="FNanchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor">1191</a>, which is the boundary of Liguria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span></p>

<p>Extending behind all the before-mentioned places are the
Apennines, the most considerable of all the mountains of
Italy, the chain of which extends unbroken from the
Alps<a id="FNanchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor">1192</a> to the Sicilian sea. On the other side of the Apennines,
towards the Padus<a id="FNanchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor">1193</a>, the richest river of Italy, the
whole country is adorned with noble towns; Libarna<a id="FNanchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor">1194</a>, the

Aquæ Statiellorum<a id="FNanchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor">1205</a>. This is the ninth region, according to
the arrangement of Augustus. The coast of Liguria extends
211 miles<a id="FNanchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor">1206</a>, between the rivers Varus and Macra.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_8">CHAP. 8.—THE SEVENTH REGION OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>Next to this comes the seventh region, in which is Etruria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
a district which begins at the river Macra, and has often
changed its name. At an early period the Umbri were expelled
from it by the Pelasgi; and these again by the Lydians,
who from a king of theirs<a id="FNanchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor">1207</a> were named Tyrrheni, but afterwards,
from the rites observed in their sacrifices, were called,
in the Greek language<a id="FNanchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor">1208</a>, Tusci. The first town in Etruria is
Luna<a id="FNanchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor">1209</a>, with a noble harbour, then the colony of Luca<a id="FNanchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor">1210</a>,
at some distance from the sea, and nearer to it again the
colony of Pisæ<a id="FNanchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor">1211</a>, between the rivers Auser<a id="FNanchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor">1212</a> and Arnus<a id="FNanchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor">1213</a>, which
owes its origin to Pelops and the Pisans<a id="FNanchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor">1214</a>, or else to the Teutani,
a people of Greece. Next is Vada<a id="FNanchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor">1215</a> Volaterrana, then
the river Cecinna<a id="FNanchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor">1216</a>, and Populonium<a id="FNanchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor">1217</a> formerly belonging
to the Etrurians, the only town they had on this coast.
Next to these is the river Prile<a id="FNanchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor">1218</a>, then the Umbro<a id="FNanchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor">1219</a>, which is
navigable, and where the district of Umbria begins, the port
of Telamon<a id="FNanchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor">1220</a>, Cosa<a id="FNanchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor">1221</a> of the Volcientes, founded by the Roman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
people, Graviscæ<a id="FNanchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor">1222</a>, Castrum novum<a id="FNanchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor">1223</a>, Pyrgi<a id="FNanchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor">1224</a>, the river Cæretanus<a id="FNanchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor">1225</a>,
and Cære<a id="FNanchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor">1226</a> itself, four miles inland, called Agylla by
the Pelasgi who founded it, Alsium<a id="FNanchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor">1227</a>, Fregenæ<a id="FNanchor_1228" href="#Footnote_1228" class="fnanchor">1228</a>, and the river
Tiber, 284<a id="FNanchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor">1229</a> miles from the Macra.</p>

<p>In the interior we have the colonies of Falisci<a id="FNanchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor">1230</a>, founded by
the Argives, according to the account of Cato<a id="FNanchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor">1231</a>, and surnamed
Falisci Etruscorum, Lucus Feroniæ<a id="FNanchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor">1232</a>, Rusellana, the
Senienses<a id="FNanchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor">1233</a>, and Sutrina<a id="FNanchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor">1234</a>. The remaining peoples are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>

<p>The Tiber or Tiberis, formerly called Thybris, and previously
Albula<a id="FNanchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor">1265</a>, flows down from nearly the central part of
the chain of the Apennines, in the territory of the Arretini.
It is at first small, and only navigable by means of sluices,
in which the water is dammed up and then discharged, in the
same manner as the Timia<a id="FNanchor_1266" href="#Footnote_1266" class="fnanchor">1266</a> and the Glanis, which flow into
it; for which purpose it is found necessary to collect the water
for nine days, unless there should happen to be a fall of rain.
And even then, the Tiber, by reason of its rugged and uneven
channel, is really more suitable for navigation by rafts than
by vessels, for any great distance. It winds along for a
course of 150 miles, passing not far from Tifernum<a id="FNanchor_1267" href="#Footnote_1267" class="fnanchor">1267</a>, Perusia,
and Ocriculum<a id="FNanchor_1268" href="#Footnote_1268" class="fnanchor">1268</a>, and dividing Etruria from the Umbri<a id="FNanchor_1269" href="#Footnote_1269" class="fnanchor">1269</a> and
the Sabini<a id="FNanchor_1270" href="#Footnote_1270" class="fnanchor">1270</a>, and then, at a distance of less than sixteen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
miles from the city, separating the territory of Veii from
that of Crustuminum, and afterwards that of the Fidenates
and of Latium from Vaticanum.</p>

<p>Below its union with the Glanis from Arretinum the Tiber
is swollen by two and forty streams, particularly the Nar<a id="FNanchor_1271" href="#Footnote_1271" class="fnanchor">1271</a>
and the Anio, which last is also navigable and shuts in
Latium at the back; it is also increased by the numerous
aqueducts and springs which are conveyed to the City. Here
it becomes navigable by vessels of any burden which may come
up from the Italian sea; a most tranquil dispenser of the
produce of all parts of the earth, and peopled and embellished
along its banks with more villas than nearly all the other
rivers of the world taken together. And yet there is no
river more circumscribed than it, so close are its banks shut
in on either side; but still, no resistance does it offer, although
its waters frequently rise with great suddenness, and no part
is more liable to be swollen than that which runs through
the City itself. In such case, however, the Tiber is rather
to be looked upon<a id="FNanchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor">1272</a> as pregnant with prophetic warnings to
us, and in its increase to be considered more as a promoter
of religion than a source of devastation.</p>

<p>Latium<a id="FNanchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor">1273</a> has preserved its original limits, from the Tiber
to Circeii<a id="FNanchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor">1274</a>, a distance of fifty miles: so slender at the beginning
were the roots from which this our Empire sprang.
Its inhabitants have been often changed, and different
nations have peopled it at different times, the Aborigines,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
the Pelasgi, the Arcades, the Seculi, the Aurunci, the Rutuli,
and, beyond Circeii, the Volsci, the Osci, and the Ausones
whence the name of Latium came to be extended as far as
the river Liris<a id="FNanchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor">1275</a>.</p>

<p>We will begin with Ostia<a id="FNanchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor">1276</a>, a colony founded by a king of
Rome, the town of Laurentum<a id="FNanchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor">1277</a>, the grove of Jupiter Indiges<a id="FNanchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor">1278</a>,
the river Numicius<a id="FNanchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor">1279</a>, and Ardea<a id="FNanchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor">1280</a>, founded by Danaë, the
mother of Perseus. Next come the former site of Aphrodisium<a id="FNanchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor">1281</a>,
the colony of Antium<a id="FNanchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor">1282</a>, the river and island called
Astura<a id="FNanchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor">1283</a>, the river Nymphæus<a id="FNanchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor">1284</a>, the Clostra Romana<a id="FNanchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor">1285</a>, and
Circeii<a id="FNanchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor">1286</a>, formerly an island, and, if we are to believe Homer,
surrounded by the open sea, though now by an extensive plain.
The circumstances which we are enabled to publish on this
subject for the information of the world are very remarkable.
Theophrastus, the first foreigner who treated of the affairs of
Rome with any degree of accuracy (for Theopompus, before
whose time no Greek writer had made mention of us, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
stated the fact that the city had been taken by the Gauls,
and Clitarchus, the next after him, only spoke of the embassy
that was sent by the Romans to Alexander)—Theophrastus,
I say, following something more than mere rumour, has
given the circuit of the island of Circeii as being eighty stadia,
in the volume which he wrote during the archonship of Nicodorus
at Athens<a id="FNanchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor">1287</a>, being the 440th year of our city. Whatever
land therefore has been annexed to that island beyond the
circumference of about ten miles, has been added to Italy
since the year previously mentioned.</p>

<p>Another wonderful circumstance too.—Near Circeii are
the Pomptine Marshes<a id="FNanchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor">1288</a>, formerly the site, according to
Mucianus, who was thrice consul, of four-and-twenty cities.
Next to this comes the river Ufens<a id="FNanchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor">1289</a>, upon which is the
town of Terracina<a id="FNanchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor">1290</a>, called, in the language of the Volsci,
Anxur; the spot too where Amyclæ<a id="FNanchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor">1291</a> stood, a town destroyed
by serpents. Next is the site of the Grotto<a id="FNanchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor">1292</a>, Lake
Fundanus<a id="FNanchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor">1293</a>, the port of Caieta<a id="FNanchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor">1294</a>, and then the town of Formiæ<a id="FNanchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor">1295</a>,
formerly called Hormiæ, the ancient seat of the Læstrygones<a id="FNanchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor">1296</a>,
it is supposed. Beyond this, formerly stood the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
town of Pyræ; and we then come to the colony of Minturnæ<a id="FNanchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor">1297</a>,
which still exists, and is divided<a id="FNanchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor">1298</a> by the river Liris,
also called the Glanis. The town of Sinuessa<a id="FNanchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor">1299</a> is the last in
the portion which has been added to Latium; it is said by
some that it used to be called Sinope.</p>

<p>At this spot begins that blessed country Campania<a id="FNanchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor">1300</a>, and
in this vale first take their rise those hills clad with vines, the
juice of whose grape is extolled by Fame all over the world;
the happy spot where, as the ancients used to say, father
Liber and Ceres are ever striving for the mastery. Hence
the fields of Setia<a id="FNanchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor">1301</a> and of Cæcubum<a id="FNanchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor">1302</a> extend afar, and, next
to them those of Falernum<a id="FNanchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor">1303</a> and of Calinum<a id="FNanchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor">1304</a>. As soon as we
have passed these, the hills of Massica<a id="FNanchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor">1305</a>, of Gaurus<a id="FNanchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor">1306</a>, and of
Surrentum rise to our view. Next, the level plains of Laborium<a id="FNanchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor">1307</a>
are spread out far and wide, where every care is bestowed
on cultivating crops of spelt, from which the most delicate
fermenty is made. These shores are watered by warm
springs<a id="FNanchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor">1308</a>, while the seas are distinguished beyond all others
for the superlative excellence of their shell and other fish.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
In no country too has the oil of the olive a more exquisite
flavour. This territory, a battle-ground as it were for the
gratification of every luxurious pleasure of man, has been
held successively by the Osci, the Greeks, the Umbri, the
Tusci, and the Campani.</p>

<p>On the coast we first meet with the river Savo<a id="FNanchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor">1309</a>, the town
of Volturnum with a river<a id="FNanchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor">1310</a> of the same name, the town of
Liternum<a id="FNanchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor">1311</a>, Cumæ<a id="FNanchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor">1312</a>, a Chalcidian colony, Misenum<a id="FNanchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor">1313</a>, the port
of Baiæ<a id="FNanchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor">1314</a>, Bauli<a id="FNanchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor">1315</a>, the Lucrine Lake<a id="FNanchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor">1316</a>, and Lake Avernus, near
which there stood formerly a town<a id="FNanchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor">1317</a> of the Cimmerians. We
then come to Puteoli<a id="FNanchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor">1318</a>, formerly called the colony of Dicæarchia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
then the Phlegræan<a id="FNanchor_1319" href="#Footnote_1319" class="fnanchor">1319</a> Plains, and the Marsh of
Acherusia<a id="FNanchor_1320" href="#Footnote_1320" class="fnanchor">1320</a> in the vicinity of Cumæ.</p>

<p>Again, on the coast we have Neapolis<a id="FNanchor_1321" href="#Footnote_1321" class="fnanchor">1321</a>, also a colony of
the Chalcidians, and called Parthenope from the tomb there
of one of the Sirens, Herculaneum<a id="FNanchor_1322" href="#Footnote_1322" class="fnanchor">1322</a>, Pompeii<a id="FNanchor_1323" href="#Footnote_1323" class="fnanchor">1323</a>, from which
Mount Vesuvius may be seen at no great distance, and
which is watered by the river Sarnus<a id="FNanchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor">1324</a>; the territory of
Nuceria, and, at the distance of nine miles from the sea, the
town of that name<a id="FNanchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor">1325</a>, and then Surrentum<a id="FNanchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor">1326</a>, with the Promontory
of Minerva<a id="FNanchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor">1327</a>, formerly the abode of the Sirens. The
distance thence by sea to Circeii is seventy-eight miles. This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
region, beginning at the Tiber, is looked upon as the first of
Italy according to the division of Augustus.</p>

<p>Inland there are the following colonies:—Capua<a id="FNanchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor">1328</a>, so
called from its champaign country, Aquinum<a id="FNanchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor">1329</a>, Suessa<a id="FNanchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor">1330</a>, Venafrum<a id="FNanchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor">1331</a>,

all, Rome herself, whose other name<a id="FNanchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor">1385</a> the hallowed mysteries
of the sacred rites forbid us to mention without being guilty
of the greatest impiety. After it had been long kept buried
in secresy with the strictest fidelity and in respectful and
salutary silence, Valerius Soranus dared to divulge it, but
soon did he pay the penalty<a id="FNanchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor">1386</a> of his rashness.</p>

<p>It will not perhaps be altogether foreign to the purpose,
if I here make mention of one peculiar institution of our
forefathers which bears especial reference to the inculcation
of silence on religious matters. The goddess Angerona<a id="FNanchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor">1387</a>,
to whom sacrifice is offered on the twelfth day before the
calends of January [21st December], is represented in her
statue as having her mouth bound with a sealed fillet.</p>

<p>Romulus left the city of Rome, if we are to believe those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
who state the very greatest number, having three<a id="FNanchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor">1388</a> gates and
no more. When the Vespasians were emperors<a id="FNanchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor">1389</a> and censors,
in the year from its building 826, the circumference of the
walls which surrounded it was thirteen miles and two-fifths.
Surrounding as it does the Seven Hills, the city is divided
into fourteen districts, with 265 cross-roads<a id="FNanchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor">1390</a> under the
guardianship of the Lares. If a straight line is drawn
from the mile-column<a id="FNanchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor">1391</a> placed at the entrance of the
Forum, to each of the gates, which are at present thirty-seven
in number (taking care to count only once the
twelve double gates, and to omit the seven old ones, which
no longer exist), the result will be [taking them altogether],
a straight line of twenty miles and 765 paces<a id="FNanchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor">1392</a>. But if we
draw a straight line from the same mile-column to the very
last of the houses, including therein the Prætorian encampment,
and follow throughout the line of all the streets, the
result will then be something more than seventy miles. Add
to these calculations the height of the houses, and then a
person may form a fair idea of this city, and will certainly
be obliged to admit that there is not a place throughout the
whole world that for size can be compared to it. On the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
eastern side it is bounded by the <em>agger</em> of Tarquinius Superbus,
a work of surpassing grandeur; for he raised it
so high as to be on a level with the walls on the side
on which the city lay most exposed to attack from the neighbouring
plains. On all the other sides it has been fortified
either with lofty walls or steep and precipitous hills<a id="FNanchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor">1393</a>, but so
it is, that its buildings, increasing and extending beyond all
bounds, have now united many other cities to it<a id="FNanchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor">1394</a>.</p>

<p>Besides those previously mentioned, there were formerly
in the first region the following famous towns of Latium:
Satricum<a id="FNanchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor">1395</a>, Pometia<a id="FNanchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor">1396</a>, Scaptia, Politorium<a id="FNanchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor">1397</a>, Tellene, Tifata,

take part in the sacrifices<a id="FNanchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor">1411</a> upon the Alban Mount, the Albani,

Octulani, the Pedani<a id="FNanchor_1419" href="#Footnote_1419" class="fnanchor">1419</a>, the Polluscini, the Querquetulani, the
Sicani, the Sisolenses, the Tolerienses, the Tutienses, the Vimitellarii,
the Velienses, the Venetulani, and the Vitellenses.
Thus we see, fifty-three peoples of ancient Latium have
passed away without leaving any traces of their existence.</p>

<p>In the Campanian territory there was also the town of
Stabiæ<a id="FNanchor_1420" href="#Footnote_1420" class="fnanchor">1420</a>, until the consulship of Cneius Pompeius and L.
Cato, when, on the day before the calends of May [30th of
April], it was destroyed in the Social War by L. Sulla the
legatus, and all that now stands on its site is a single farmhouse.
Here also Taurania has ceased to exist, and the
remains of Casilinum<a id="FNanchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor">1421</a> are fast going to ruin. Besides these,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
we learn from Antias that king L. Tarquinius took Apiolæ<a id="FNanchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor">1422</a>,
a town of the Latins, and with its spoils laid the first foundations
of the Capitol. From Surrentum<a id="FNanchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor">1423</a> to the river
Silarus<a id="FNanchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor">1424</a>, the former territory of Picentia<a id="FNanchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor">1425</a> extends for a
distance of thirty miles. This belonged to the Etruscans,
and was remarkable for the temple of the Argive Juno,
founded by Jason<a id="FNanchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor">1426</a>. In it was Picentia, a town<a id="FNanchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor">1427</a> of the territory
of Salernum<a id="FNanchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor">1428</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_10">CHAP. 10.—THE THIRD REGION OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>At the Silarus begins the third region of Italy, consisting
of the territory of Lucania and Bruttium; here too there
have been no few changes of the population. These districts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
have been possessed by tbe Pelasgi, the Œnotrii, the Itali,
the Morgetes, the Siculi, and more especially by people who
emigrated from Greece<a id="FNanchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor">1429</a>, and, last of all, by the Leucani, a
people sprung from the Samnites, who took possession under
the command of Lucius. We find here the town of Pæstum<a id="FNanchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor">1430</a>,
which received from the Greeks the name of Posidonia, the
Gulf of Pæstum<a id="FNanchor_1431" href="#Footnote_1431" class="fnanchor">1431</a>, the town of Elea, now known as Velia<a id="FNanchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor">1432</a>,
and the Promontory of Palinurum<a id="FNanchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor">1433</a>, a point at which the land
falls inwards and forms a bay<a id="FNanchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor">1434</a>, the distance across which to
the pillar<a id="FNanchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor">1435</a> of Rhegium is 100 miles. Next after Palinurum
comes the river Melpes<a id="FNanchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor">1436</a>, then the town of Buxentum<a id="FNanchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor">1437</a>,
called in [Magna] Græcia Pyxus, and the river Laus; there
was formerly a town<a id="FNanchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor">1438</a> also of the same name.</p>

<p>At this spot begins the coast of Bruttium, and we come
to the town of Blanda<a id="FNanchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor">1439</a>, the river Batum<a id="FNanchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor">1440</a>, Parthenius, a

Clampetia formerly stood, the town of Temsa<a id="FNanchor_1443" href="#Footnote_1443" class="fnanchor">1443</a>, called Temese
by the Greeks, and Terina founded by the people of Crotona<a id="FNanchor_1444" href="#Footnote_1444" class="fnanchor">1444</a>,
with the extensive Gulf of Terina; more inland, the town of
Consentia<a id="FNanchor_1445" href="#Footnote_1445" class="fnanchor">1445</a>. Situate upon a peninsula<a id="FNanchor_1446" href="#Footnote_1446" class="fnanchor">1446</a> is the river Acheron<a id="FNanchor_1447" href="#Footnote_1447" class="fnanchor">1447</a>,
from which the people of Acherontia derive the name
of their town; then Hippo, now called Vibo Valentia,
the Port of Hercules<a id="FNanchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor">1448</a>, the river Metaurus<a id="FNanchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor">1449</a>, the town of
Tauroentum<a id="FNanchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor">1450</a>, the Port of Orestes, and Medma<a id="FNanchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor">1451</a>. Next, the
town of Scyllæum<a id="FNanchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor">1452</a>, the river Cratæis<a id="FNanchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor">1453</a>, the mother of Scylla
it is said; then the Pillar of Rhegium, the Straits of Sicily,
and the two promontories which face each other, Cænys<a id="FNanchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor">1454</a> on
the Italian, and Pelorus<a id="FNanchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor">1455</a> on the Sicilian side, the distance between
them being twelve stadia. At a distance thence of
twelve miles and a half, we come to Rhegium<a id="FNanchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor">1456</a>, after which
begins Sila<a id="FNanchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor">1457</a>, a forest of the Apennines, and then the promontory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
of Leucopetra<a id="FNanchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor">1458</a>, at a distance of fifteen miles; after
which come the Locri<a id="FNanchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor">1459</a>, who take their surname from the
promontory of Zephyrium<a id="FNanchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor">1460</a>, being distant from the river
Silarus 303 miles.</p>

<p>At this spot ends the first<a id="FNanchor_1461" href="#Footnote_1461" class="fnanchor">1461</a> great Gulf of Europe; the
seas in which bear the following names:—That from
which it takes its rise is called the Atlantic, by some the
Great Atlantic, the entrance of which is, by the Greeks,
called Porthmos, by us the Straits of Gades. After its
entrance, as far as it washes the coasts of Spain, it is called
the Hispanian Sea, though some give it the name of the
Iberian or Balearic<a id="FNanchor_1462" href="#Footnote_1462" class="fnanchor">1462</a> Sea. Where it faces the province of
Gallia Narbonensis it has the name of the Gallic, and after
that, of the Ligurian, Sea. From Liguria to the island of
Sicily, it is called the Tuscan Sea, the same which is called
by some of the Greeks the Notian<a id="FNanchor_1463" href="#Footnote_1463" class="fnanchor">1463</a>, by others the Tyrrhenian,
while many of our people call it the Lower Sea.
Beyond Sicily, as far as the country of the Salentini, it is
styled by Polybius the Ausonian Sea. Eratosthenes however
gives to the whole expanse that lies between the inlet
of the ocean and the island of Sardinia, the name of the
Sardoan Sea; thence to Sicily, the Tyrrhenian; thence to
Crete, the Sicilian; and beyond that island, the Cretan Sea.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_11">CHAP. 11.—SIXTY-FOUR ISLANDS, AMONG WHICH ARE THE
BALEARES.</h3></div>

<p>The first islands that we meet with in all these seas are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
the two to which the Greeks have given the name of Pityussæ<a id="FNanchor_1464" href="#Footnote_1464" class="fnanchor">1464</a>,
from the pine-tree<a id="FNanchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor">1465</a>, which they produce. These islands now
bear the name of Ebusus, and form a federate state. They
are separated by a narrow strait<a id="FNanchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor">1466</a> of the sea, and are forty-six<a id="FNanchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor">1467</a>
miles in extent. They are distant from Dianium<a id="FNanchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor">1468</a> 700 stadia,
Dianium being by land the same distance<a id="FNanchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor">1469</a> from New Carthage.
At the same distance<a id="FNanchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor">1470</a> from the Pityussæ, lie, in the
open sea, the two Baleares, and, over against the river Sucro<a id="FNanchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor">1471</a>,
Colubraria<a id="FNanchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor">1472</a>. The Baleares<a id="FNanchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor">1473</a>, so formidable in war with
their slingers<a id="FNanchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor">1474</a>, have received from the Greeks the name of
Gymnasiæ.</p>

<p>The larger island is 100<a id="FNanchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor">1475</a> miles in length, and 475 in circumference.
It has the following towns; Palma<a id="FNanchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor">1476</a> and Pollentia<a id="FNanchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor">1477</a>,
enjoying the rights of Roman citizens, Cinium<a id="FNanchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor">1478</a> and
Tucis, with Latin rights: Bocchorum, a federate town, is
no longer in existence. At thirty miles’ distance is the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
smaller island, 40 miles in length, and 150<a id="FNanchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor">1479</a> in circumference;
it contains the states of Jamnon<a id="FNanchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor">1480</a>, Sanisera, and Magon<a id="FNanchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor">1481</a>.</p>

<p>In the open sea, at twelve miles’ distance from the larger
island, is Capraria<a id="FNanchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor">1482</a> with its treacherous coast, so notorious for
its numerous shipwrecks; and, opposite to the city of Palma,
are the islands known as the Mænariæ<a id="FNanchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor">1483</a>, Tiquadra<a id="FNanchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor">1484</a>, and Little
Hannibalis<a id="FNanchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor">1485</a>.</p>

<p>The earth of Ebusus has the effect of driving away serpents,
while that of Colubraria produces them; hence the latter spot
is dangerous to all persons who have not brought with them
some of the earth of Ebusus. The Greeks have given it
the name of Ophiusa<a id="FNanchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor">1486</a>. Ebusus too produces no<a id="FNanchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor">1487</a> rabbits to
destroy the harvests of the Baleares. There are also about
twenty other small islands in this sea, which is full of shoals.
Off the coast of Gaul, at the mouth of the Rhodanus, there
is Metina<a id="FNanchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor">1488</a>, and near it the island which is known as Blascon<a id="FNanchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor">1489</a>,
with the three Stœchades, so called by their neighbours the
Massilians<a id="FNanchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor">1490</a>, on account of the regular order in which they
are placed; their respective names are Prote<a id="FNanchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor">1491</a>, Mese<a id="FNanchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor">1492</a>, also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
called Pomponiana, and Hypæa<a id="FNanchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor">1493</a>. After these come Sturium<a id="FNanchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor">1494</a>,
Phœnice, Phila, Lero, and, opposite to Antipolis<a id="FNanchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor">1495</a>,
Lerina<a id="FNanchor_1496" href="#Footnote_1496" class="fnanchor">1496</a>, where there is a remembrance of a town called
Vergoanum having once existed.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_12">CHAP. 12. (6.)—CORSICA.</h3></div>

<p>In the Ligurian Sea, but close to the Tuscan, is Corsica,
by the Greeks called Cyrnos, extending, from north to
south 150 miles, and for the most part 50 miles in breadth,
its circumference being 325. It is 62 miles distant from
the Vada Volaterrana<a id="FNanchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor">1497</a>. It contains thirty-two states, and
two colonies, that of Mariana<a id="FNanchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor">1498</a>, founded by C. Marius, and
that of Aleria, founded by the Dictator Sylla. On this
side of it is Oglasa<a id="FNanchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor">1499</a>, and, at a distance of less than sixty
miles from Corsica, Planaria<a id="FNanchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor">1500</a>, so called from its appearance,
being nearly level with the sea, and consequently
treacherous to mariners.</p>

<p>We next have Urgo<a id="FNanchor_1501" href="#Footnote_1501" class="fnanchor">1501</a>, a larger island, and Capraria, which
the Greeks have called Ægilion<a id="FNanchor_1502" href="#Footnote_1502" class="fnanchor">1502</a>; then Igilium<a id="FNanchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor">1503</a> and Dianium<a id="FNanchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor">1504</a>,
which they have also called Artemisia, both of them
opposite the coast of Cosa; also Barpana<a id="FNanchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor">1505</a>, Mænaria, Columbaria,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
and Venaria. We then come to Ilva<a id="FNanchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor">1506</a> with its iron
mines, an island 100 miles in circumference, 10 miles distant
from Populonium, and called Æthalia by the Greeks: from
it the island of Planasia<a id="FNanchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor">1507</a> is distant 28 miles. After these,
beyond the mouths of the Tiber, and off the coast of Antium,
we come to Astura<a id="FNanchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor">1508</a>, then Palmaria and Sinonia, and, opposite
to Formiæ, Pontiæ. In the Gulf of Puteoli are Pandateria<a id="FNanchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor">1509</a>,
and Prochyta, so called, not from the nurse of
Æneas, but because it has been poured forth<a id="FNanchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor">1510</a> or detached
from Ænaria<a id="FNanchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor">1511</a>, an island which received its name from having
been the anchorage of the fleet of Æneas, though called
by Homer Inarime<a id="FNanchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor">1512</a>; it is also called Pithecusa, not, as
many have fancied, on account of the multitudes of apes
found there, but from its extensive manufactories of pottery.
Between Pausilipum<a id="FNanchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor">1513</a> and Neapolis lies the island of Megaris<a id="FNanchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor">1514</a>,
and then, at a distance of eight miles from Surrentum,
Capreæ<a id="FNanchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor">1515</a>, famous for the castle of the emperor Tiberius: it
is eleven miles in circumference.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_13">CHAP. 13.—SARDINIA.</h3></div>

<p>Leucothea comes next, and after it, but out of sight, as it
lies upon the verge of the African Sea, Sardinia. It is situate
somewhat less<a id="FNanchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor">1516</a> than eight miles from the nearest point of
Corsica, and the Straits between them are even still more
reduced by the small islands there situate, called the Cuniculariæ<a id="FNanchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor">1517</a>,
as also those of Phintonis<a id="FNanchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor">1518</a> and Fossæ, from
which last the Straits themselves have obtained the name of
Taphros<a id="FNanchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor">1519</a>.</p>

<p>(7.) Sardinia extends, upon the east side, a distance of
188 miles, on the west 175, on the south 77, and on the
north 125, being 565 miles in circumference. Its promontory
of Caralis<a id="FNanchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor">1520</a> is distant from Africa 200, and from
Gades 1400 miles. Off the promontory of Gordis<a id="FNanchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor">1521</a> it has
two islands called the Isles of Hercules<a id="FNanchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor">1522</a>, off that of Sulcis,
the island of Enosis<a id="FNanchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor">1523</a>, and off that of Caralis, Ficaria<a id="FNanchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor">1524</a>. Some
writers place Beleris not far from it, as also Callodis, and the
island known as Heras Lutra<a id="FNanchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor">1525</a>.</p>

<p>The most celebrated peoples of this island are the Ilienses<a id="FNanchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor">1526</a>,
the Balari, and the Corsi; and among its eighteen towns,
there are those of the Sulcitani<a id="FNanchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor">1527</a>, the Valentini<a id="FNanchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor">1528</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
the Neapolitani<a id="FNanchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor">1529</a>, the Bosenses<a id="FNanchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor">1530</a>, the Caralitani<a id="FNanchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor">1531</a>, who enjoy the rights of
Roman citizens, and the Norenses<a id="FNanchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor">1532</a>. There is also one colony
which is called Ad Turrim Libysonis<a id="FNanchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor">1533</a>. Timæus has called
this island Sandaliotis, on account of the similarity of its shape
to the sole of a shoe, while Myrtilus has given it the name of
Ichnusa<a id="FNanchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor">1534</a>, from its resemblance to the print of a footstep.
Opposite to the Gulf of Pæstum is Leucasia<a id="FNanchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor">1535</a>, so called from
a Siren who is buried there; opposite to Velia are Pontia
and Isacia, both known by one name, that of Œnotrides, a
proof that Italy was formerly possessed by the Œnotrians.
Opposite to Vibo are the little islands called Ithacesiæ<a id="FNanchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor">1536</a>,
from the watch-tower of Ulysses situate there.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_14">CHAP. 14. (8.)—SICILY.</h3></div>

<p>But more celebrated than all is Sicily, called Sicania by
Thucydides, and by many writers Trinacria or Trinacia, from
its triangular appearance. According to Agrippa it is 618<a id="FNanchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor">1537</a>
miles in circumference. In former times it was a continuation
of the territory of Bruttium, but, in consequence of
the overflowing of the sea, became severed from it; thus forming
a strait of 15 miles in length, and a mile and a half in
width in the vicinity of the Pillar of Rhegium. It was from
this circumstance of the land being severed asunder that
the Greeks gave the name of Rhegium<a id="FNanchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor">1538</a> to the town situate
on the Italian shore.</p>

<p>In these Straits is the rock of Scylla, as also Charybdis<a id="FNanchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor">1539</a>, a
whirlpool of the sea, both of them noted for their perils. Of
this triangle, the promontory, which, as we have already<a id="FNanchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor">1540</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
mentioned, is called Pelorus, faces Scylla and juts out towards
Italy, while Pachynum<a id="FNanchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor">1541</a> extends in the direction of Greece,
Peloponnesus being at a distance from it of 440 miles, and
Lilybæum<a id="FNanchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor">1542</a>, towards Africa, being distant 180 miles from the
promontory of Mercury<a id="FNanchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor">1543</a>, and from that of Caralis in Sardinia
190. These promontories and sides are situate at the
following distances from each other: by land it is 186 miles
from Pelorus to Pachynum, from Pachynum to Lilybæum
200, and from Lilybæum to Pelorus 170<a id="FNanchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor">1544</a>.</p>

<p>In this island there are five colonies and sixty-three cities
or states. Leaving Pelorus and facing the Ionian Sea, we
have the town of Messana<a id="FNanchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor">1545</a>, whose inhabitants are also called
Mamertini and enjoy the rights of Roman citizens; the
promontory of Drepanum<a id="FNanchor_1546" href="#Footnote_1546" class="fnanchor">1546</a>, the colony of Tauromenium<a id="FNanchor_1547" href="#Footnote_1547" class="fnanchor">1547</a>,
formerly called Naxos, the river Asines<a id="FNanchor_1548" href="#Footnote_1548" class="fnanchor">1548</a>, and Mount Ætna,
wondrous for the flames which it emits by night. Its crater
is twenty stadia in circumference, and from it red-hot
cinders are thrown as far as Tauromenium and Catina, the
noise being heard even at Maroneum<a id="FNanchor_1549" href="#Footnote_1549" class="fnanchor">1549</a> and the Gemellian
Hills. We then come to the three rocks of the Cyclopes<a id="FNanchor_1550" href="#Footnote_1550" class="fnanchor">1550</a>,
the Port of Ulysses<a id="FNanchor_1551" href="#Footnote_1551" class="fnanchor">1551</a>, the colony of Catina<a id="FNanchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor">1552</a>, and the rivers
Symæthus<a id="FNanchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor">1553</a> and Terias; while more inland lie the Læstrygonian
Plains.</p>

<p>To these rivers succeed the towns of Leontinum<a id="FNanchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor">1554</a> and
Megaris, the river Pantagies<a id="FNanchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor">1555</a>, the colony of Syracuse<a id="FNanchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor">1556</a>, with
the fountain of Arethusa<a id="FNanchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor">1557</a>, (the people in the Syracusan territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
drink too of the fountains of Temenitis<a id="FNanchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor">1558</a>, Archidemia,
Magæa, Cyane, and Milichie,) the port of Naustathmus<a id="FNanchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor">1559</a>, the
river Elorus, and the promontory of Pachynum. This
side<a id="FNanchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor">1560</a> of Sicily begins with the river Hirminius<a id="FNanchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor">1561</a>, then follow
the town of Camarina<a id="FNanchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor">1562</a>, the river Gelas<a id="FNanchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor">1563</a>, and the town
of Agragas<a id="FNanchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor">1564</a>, which our people have named Agrigentum. We
next come to the colony of Thermæ<a id="FNanchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor">1565</a>, the rivers Achates<a id="FNanchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor">1566</a>,
Mazara, and Hypsa; the town of Selinus<a id="FNanchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor">1567</a>, and then the
Promontory of Lilybæum, which is succeeded by Drepana<a id="FNanchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor">1568</a>,
Mount Eryx<a id="FNanchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor">1569</a>, the towns of Panhormus<a id="FNanchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor">1570</a>, Solus<a id="FNanchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor">1571</a> and Himera<a id="FNanchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor">1572</a>,
with a river of the same name, Cephalœdis<a id="FNanchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor">1573</a>, Aluntium<a id="FNanchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor">1574</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>

and then Pelorus, the spot at which we began.</p>

<p>In the interior there are the following towns enjoying
Latin privileges, those of the Centuripini<a id="FNanchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor">1577</a>, the Netini<a id="FNanchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor">1578</a>, and
the Segestani<a id="FNanchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor">1579</a>; tributary towns are those of the Assorini<a id="FNanchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor">1580</a>,

and the Zanclæi<a id="FNanchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor">1614</a>, a Messenian colony on the Straits
of Sicily. Towards Africa, its islands are Gaulos<a id="FNanchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor">1615</a>, Melita,
87 miles from Camerina, and 113 from Lilybæum, Cosyra<a id="FNanchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor">1616</a>,
Hieronnesos<a id="FNanchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor">1617</a>, Cæne<a id="FNanchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor">1618</a>, Galata<a id="FNanchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor">1619</a>, Lopadusa, Æthusa, written
by some Ægusa, Bucinna<a id="FNanchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor">1620</a>, Osteodes<a id="FNanchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor">1621</a>, distant from Soluntum
75 miles, and, opposite to Paropus, Ustica.</p>

<p>On this side of Sicily, facing the river Metaurus, at a distance
of nearly 25<a id="FNanchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor">1622</a> miles from Italy, are the seven<a id="FNanchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor">1623</a> islands
called the Æolian, as also the Liparæan islands; by the
Greeks they are called the Hephæstiades, and by our writers
the Vulcanian<a id="FNanchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor">1624</a> Isles; they are called “Æolian” because in
the Trojan times Æolus was king there.</p>

<p>(9.) Lipara<a id="FNanchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor">1625</a>, with a town whose inhabitants enjoy the
rights of Roman citizens, is so called from Liparus, a former
king who succeeded<a id="FNanchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor">1626</a> Æolus, it having been previously called
Melogonis or Meligunis. It is 25 miles<a id="FNanchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor">1627</a> distant from Italy,
and in circumference a little less. Between this island and
Sicily we find another, the name of which was formerly
Therasia, but now called Hiera, because it is sacred to
Vulcan<a id="FNanchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor">1628</a>: it contains a hill which at night vomits forth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
flames. The third island is Strongyle<a id="FNanchor_1629" href="#Footnote_1629" class="fnanchor">1629</a>, lying one mile<a id="FNanchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor">1630</a> to
the east of Lipara, over which Æolus reigned as well; it
differs only from Lipara in the superior brilliancy of its
flames. From the smoke of this volcano it is said that some
of the inhabitants are able to predict three days beforehand
what winds are about to blow; hence arose the notion that
the winds are governed by Æolus. The fourth of these
islands is Didyme<a id="FNanchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor">1631</a>, smaller than Lipara, the fifth Ericusa,
the sixth Phœnicusa, left to be a pasture-ground for the
cattle of the neighbouring islands, and the last and smallest
Euonymos. Thus much as to the first great Gulf of
Europe.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_15">CHAP. 15. (10.)—MAGNA GRÆCIA, BEGINNING AT LOCRI.</h3></div>

<p>At Locri begins the fore-part of Italy, called Magna
Græcia, whose coast falls back in three bays<a id="FNanchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor">1632</a> formed by the
Ausonian sea, so called from the Ausones, who were the
first inhabitants of the country. According to Varro it is
86 miles in extent; but most writers have made it only 75.
Along this coast there are rivers innumerable, but we shall
mention those only that are worthy of remark. After
leaving Locri we come to the Sagra<a id="FNanchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor">1633</a>, and the ruins of the
town of Caulon, Mystiæ<a id="FNanchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor">1634</a>, Consilinum Castrum<a id="FNanchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor">1635</a>, Cocinthum<a id="FNanchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor">1636</a>,
in the opinion of some, the longest headland of Italy,
and then the Gulf of Scylacium<a id="FNanchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor">1637</a>, and Scylacium<a id="FNanchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor">1638</a> itself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
which was called by the Athenians, when they founded it,
Scylletium. This part of Italy is nearly a peninsula, in consequence
of the Gulf of Terinæum<a id="FNanchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor">1639</a> running up into it on the
other side; in it there is a harbour called Castra Hannibalis<a id="FNanchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor">1640</a>:
in no part is Italy narrower than here, it being but twenty
miles across. For this reason the Elder Dionysius entertained
the idea of severing<a id="FNanchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor">1641</a> this portion from the main-land
of Italy at this spot, and adding it to Sicily. The navigable
rivers in this district are the Carcines<a id="FNanchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor">1642</a>, the Crotalus,
the Semirus, the Arocas, and the Targines. In the interior
is the town of Petilia<a id="FNanchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor">1643</a>, and there are besides, Mount Clibanus<a id="FNanchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor">1644</a>,
the promontory of Lacinium, in front of which lies
the island of Dioscoron<a id="FNanchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor">1645</a>, ten miles from the main-land, and
another called the Isle of Calypso, which Homer is supposed
to refer to under the name of Ogygia; as also the islands of
Tiris, Eranusa, and Meloessa. According to Agrippa, the
promontory of Lacinium<a id="FNanchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor">1646</a> is seventy miles from Caulon.</p>

<p>(11.) At the promontory of Lacinium begins the second
Gulf of Europe, the bend of which forms an arc of great
depth, and terminates at Acroceraunium, a promontory of
Epirus, from which it is distant<a id="FNanchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor">1647</a> seventy-five miles. We
first come to the town of Croton<a id="FNanchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor">1648</a>, and then the river<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
Neæthus<a id="FNanchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor">1649</a>, and the town of Thurii<a id="FNanchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor">1650</a>, situate between the two
rivers Crathis and Sybaris, upon the latter of which there was
once a city<a id="FNanchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor">1651</a> of the same name. In a similar manner Heraclia<a id="FNanchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor">1652</a>,
sometimes called Siris, lies between the river of that
name and the Aciris. We next come to the rivers Acalandrus
and Casuentum<a id="FNanchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor">1653</a>, and the town of Metapontum<a id="FNanchor_1654" href="#Footnote_1654" class="fnanchor">1654</a>,
with which the third region of Italy terminates. In the
interior of Bruttium, the Aprustani<a id="FNanchor_1655" href="#Footnote_1655" class="fnanchor">1655</a> are the only people;
but in Lucania we find the Atinates, the Bantini, the Eburini<a id="FNanchor_1656" href="#Footnote_1656" class="fnanchor">1656</a>,
the Grumentini, the Potentini, the Sontini<a id="FNanchor_1657" href="#Footnote_1657" class="fnanchor">1657</a>, the Sirini,
the Tergilani, the Ursentini, and the Volcentani<a id="FNanchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor">1658</a>, whom
the Numestrani join. Besides these, we learn from Cato<a id="FNanchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor">1659</a>
that Thebes in Lucania has disappeared, and Theopompus
informs us that there was formerly a city of the Lucani called
Pandosia<a id="FNanchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor">1660</a>, at which Alexander, the king of Epirus, died.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_16">CHAP. 16.—THE SECOND REGION OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>Adjoining to this district is the second region of Italy, which
embraces the Hirpini, Calabria, Apulia, and the Salentini, extending
a distance of 250 miles along the Gulf of Tarentum,
which receives its name from a town of the Laconians so
called, situate at the bottom of the Gulf, to which was annexed
the maritime colony which had previously settled there.
Tarentum<a id="FNanchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor">1661</a> is distant from the promontory of Lacinium 136
miles, and throws out the territory of Calabria opposite to it
in the form of a peninsula. The Greeks called this territory
Messapia, from their leader<a id="FNanchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor">1662</a>; before which it was called Peucetia,
from Peucetius<a id="FNanchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor">1663</a>, the brother of Œnotrius, and was
comprised in the territory of Salentinum. Between the
two promontories<a id="FNanchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor">1664</a> there is a distance of 100 miles. The
breadth across the peninsula from Tarentum<a id="FNanchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor">1665</a> to Brundusium
by land is 35 miles, considerably less if measured from the
port of Sasina<a id="FNanchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor">1666</a>. The towns inland from Tarentum are Varia<a id="FNanchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor">1667</a>
surnamed Apulia, Messapia, and Aletium<a id="FNanchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor">1668</a>; on the coast,
Senum, and Callipolis<a id="FNanchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor">1669</a>, now known as Anxa, 75 miles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
Tarentum. Thence, at a distance of 32 miles, is the Promontory
of Acra Iapygia<a id="FNanchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor">1670</a>, at which point Italy projects
the greatest distance into the sea. At a distance of 19 miles
from this point is the town of Basta<a id="FNanchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor">1671</a>, and then Hydruntum<a id="FNanchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor">1672</a>,
the spot at which the Ionian is separated from the Adriatic
sea, and from which the distance across to Greece is the
shortest. The town of the Apolloniates<a id="FNanchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor">1673</a> lies opposite to it,
and the breadth of the arm of the sea which runs between is
not more than fifty miles. Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, was the
first who entertained the notion of uniting these two points
and making a passage on foot, by throwing a bridge across,
and after him M. Varro<a id="FNanchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor">1674</a>, when commanding the fleet of
Pompey in the war against the Pirates. Other cares however
prevented either of them from accomplishing this design.
Passing Hydruntum, we come to the deserted site of
Soletum<a id="FNanchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor">1675</a>, then Fratuertium, the Portus Tarentinus, the
haven of Miltopa, Lupia<a id="FNanchor_1676" href="#Footnote_1676" class="fnanchor">1676</a>, Balesium<a id="FNanchor_1677" href="#Footnote_1677" class="fnanchor">1677</a>, Cælia<a id="FNanchor_1678" href="#Footnote_1678" class="fnanchor">1678</a>, and then Brundusium<a id="FNanchor_1679" href="#Footnote_1679" class="fnanchor">1679</a>,
fifty miles from Hydruntum. This last place is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
one of the most famous ports of Italy, and, although more
distant, affords by far the safest passage across to Greece,
the place of disembarkation being Dyrrachium, a city of
Illyria; the distance across is 225 miles.</p>

<p>Adjoining Brundusium is the territory of the Pediculi<a id="FNanchor_1680" href="#Footnote_1680" class="fnanchor">1680</a>;
nine youths and as many maidens, natives of Illyria, became
the parents of sixteen nations. The towns of the Pediculi
are Rudiæ<a id="FNanchor_1681" href="#Footnote_1681" class="fnanchor">1681</a>, Egnatia<a id="FNanchor_1682" href="#Footnote_1682" class="fnanchor">1682</a>, and Barium<a id="FNanchor_1683" href="#Footnote_1683" class="fnanchor">1683</a>; their rivers are the Iapyx
(so called from the son of Dædalus, who was king there, and
who gave it the name of Iapygia), the Pactius<a id="FNanchor_1684" href="#Footnote_1684" class="fnanchor">1684</a>, and the
Aufidus, which rises in the Hirpinian mountains and flows
past Canusium<a id="FNanchor_1685" href="#Footnote_1685" class="fnanchor">1685</a>.</p>

<p>At this point begins Apulia, surnamed the Daunian, from the
Daunii, who take their name from a former chief, the father-in-law
of Diomedes. In this territory are the towns of Salapia<a id="FNanchor_1686" href="#Footnote_1686" class="fnanchor">1686</a>,
famous for Hannibal’s amour with a courtezan, Sipontum<a id="FNanchor_1687" href="#Footnote_1687" class="fnanchor">1687</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Uria, the river Cerbalus<a id="FNanchor_1688" href="#Footnote_1688" class="fnanchor">1688</a>, forming the boundary of the Daunii,

distant from the Promontory of Salentinum or Iapygia
234 miles. Making the circuit of Garganus, we come to the
port of Garna<a id="FNanchor_1691" href="#Footnote_1691" class="fnanchor">1691</a>, the Lake Pantanus<a id="FNanchor_1692" href="#Footnote_1692" class="fnanchor">1692</a>, the river Frento, the
mouth of which forms a harbour, Teanum of the Apuli<a id="FNanchor_1693" href="#Footnote_1693" class="fnanchor">1693</a>, and
Larinum, Cliternia<a id="FNanchor_1694" href="#Footnote_1694" class="fnanchor">1694</a>, and the river Tifernus, at which the
district of the Frentani<a id="FNanchor_1695" href="#Footnote_1695" class="fnanchor">1695</a> begins. Thus there were three
different nations of the Apulians, [the Daunii,] the Teani, so
called from their leader, and who sprang from the Greeks, and
the Lucani, who were subdued by Calchas<a id="FNanchor_1696" href="#Footnote_1696" class="fnanchor">1696</a>, and whose country
is now possessed by the Atinates. Besides those already mentioned,
there are, of the Daunii, the colonies of Luceria<a id="FNanchor_1697" href="#Footnote_1697" class="fnanchor">1697</a> and
Venusia<a id="FNanchor_1698" href="#Footnote_1698" class="fnanchor">1698</a>, the towns of Canusium<a id="FNanchor_1699" href="#Footnote_1699" class="fnanchor">1699</a> and Arpi, formerly called
Argos Hippium<a id="FNanchor_1700" href="#Footnote_1700" class="fnanchor">1700</a> and founded by Diomedes, afterwards called
Argyrippa. Here too Diomedes destroyed the nations of the

<p>Besides the above, there is in the interior of the second

<p>In these districts, the Comini<a id="FNanchor_1760" href="#Footnote_1760" class="fnanchor">1760</a>, the Tadiates, the Cædici,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
and the Alfaterni, tribes of the Æquiculi, have disappeared.
From Gellianus we learn that Archippe<a id="FNanchor_1761" href="#Footnote_1761" class="fnanchor">1761</a>, a town of the
Marsi, built by Marsyas, a chieftain of the Lydians, has
been swallowed up by Lake Fucinus, and Valerianus informs
us that the town of the Viticini in Picenum was destroyed
by the Romans. The Sabini (called, according to some
writers, from their attention to religious<a id="FNanchor_1762" href="#Footnote_1762" class="fnanchor">1762</a> observances and
the worship of the gods, Sevini) dwell on the dew-clad hills
in the vicinity of the Lakes of the Velinus<a id="FNanchor_1763" href="#Footnote_1763" class="fnanchor">1763</a>. The Nar, with
its sulphureous waters, exhausts these lakes, and, descending
from Mount Fiscellus<a id="FNanchor_1764" href="#Footnote_1764" class="fnanchor">1764</a>, unites with them near the groves of
Vacuna<a id="FNanchor_1765" href="#Footnote_1765" class="fnanchor">1765</a> and Reate, and then directs its course towards the
Tiber, into which it discharges itself. Again, in another
direction, the Anio<a id="FNanchor_1766" href="#Footnote_1766" class="fnanchor">1766</a>, taking its rise in the mountain of the
Trebani, carries into the Tiber the waters of three lakes remarkable
for their picturesque beauty, and to which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
Sublaqueum<a id="FNanchor_1767" href="#Footnote_1767" class="fnanchor">1767</a> is indebted for its name. In the territory of Reate
is the Lake of Cutiliæ<a id="FNanchor_1768" href="#Footnote_1768" class="fnanchor">1768</a>, in which there is a floating island,
and which, according to M. Varro, is the navel or central
point of Italy. Below the Sabine territory lies that of Latium,
on one side Picenum, and behind it Umbria, while
the range of the Apennines flanks it on either side.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_18">CHAP. 18. (13.)—THE FIFTH REGION OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>The fifth region is that of Picenum, once remarkable for
the denseness of its population; 360,000 Picentines took the
oaths of fidelity to the Roman people. They are descended
from the Sabines, who had made a vow to celebrate a holy
spring<a id="FNanchor_1769" href="#Footnote_1769" class="fnanchor">1769</a>. Their territory commenced at the river Aternus<a id="FNanchor_1770" href="#Footnote_1770" class="fnanchor">1770</a>,
where the present district and colony of Adria<a id="FNanchor_1771" href="#Footnote_1771" class="fnanchor">1771</a> is, at a distance
of six miles from the sea. Here we find the river Vomanus,

illustrious in Picenum; in the interior there is the town
of Novana<a id="FNanchor_1780" href="#Footnote_1780" class="fnanchor">1780</a>. Upon the coast we have Cluana<a id="FNanchor_1781" href="#Footnote_1781" class="fnanchor">1781</a>, Potentia,
Numana, founded by the Siculi, and Ancona<a id="FNanchor_1782" href="#Footnote_1782" class="fnanchor">1782</a>, a colony
founded by the same people on the Promontory of Cumerus,
forming an elbow of the coast, where it begins to bend inwards,
and distant from Garganus 183 miles. In the interior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
are the Auximates<a id="FNanchor_1783" href="#Footnote_1783" class="fnanchor">1783</a>, the Beregrani<a id="FNanchor_1784" href="#Footnote_1784" class="fnanchor">1784</a>, the Cingulani, the Cuprenses

<p>Adjoining to this is the sixth region, which includes Umbria
and the Gallic territory in the vicinity of Ariminum.
At Ancona begins the coast of that part of Gaul known as
Gallia Togata<a id="FNanchor_1789" href="#Footnote_1789" class="fnanchor">1789</a>. The Siculi and the Liburni possessed the
greater part of this district, and more particularly the territories
of Palma, of Prætutia, and of Adria. These were
expelled by the Umbri, these again by the Etrurians, and
these in their turn by the Gauls. The Umbri are thought
to have been the most ancient race in Italy, it being supposed
that they were called “Ombrii” by the Greeks, from the
fact of their having survived the rains<a id="FNanchor_1790" href="#Footnote_1790" class="fnanchor">1790</a> which had inundated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
the earth. We read that 300 of their towns were conquered
by the Tusci; at the present day we find on their coast the
river Æsis<a id="FNanchor_1791" href="#Footnote_1791" class="fnanchor">1791</a>, Senogallia<a id="FNanchor_1792" href="#Footnote_1792" class="fnanchor">1792</a>, the river Metaurus, the colonies of

the Urbanates<a id="FNanchor_1850" href="#Footnote_1850" class="fnanchor">1850</a>. In this district the Boii<a id="FNanchor_1851" href="#Footnote_1851" class="fnanchor">1851</a> have disappeared,
of whom there were 112 tribes according to Cato; as also
the Senones, who captured Rome.</p>

<p>(16.) The Padus<a id="FNanchor_1852" href="#Footnote_1852" class="fnanchor">1852</a> descends from the bosom of Mount
Vesulus, one of the most elevated points of the chain of the
Alps, in the territories of the Ligurian Vagienni<a id="FNanchor_1853" href="#Footnote_1853" class="fnanchor">1853</a>, and rises
at its source in a manner that well merits an inspection by
the curious; after which it hides itself in a subterranean
channel until it rises again in the country of the Forovibienses.
It is inferior in fame to none whatever among the
rivers, being known to the Greeks as the Eridanus and famous
as the scene of the punishment of Phaëton<a id="FNanchor_1854" href="#Footnote_1854" class="fnanchor">1854</a>. At the rising of
the Dog-star it is swollen by the melted snows; but, though
it proves more furious in its course to the adjoining fields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
than to the vessels that are upon it, still it takes care to carry
away no portion of its banks, and when it recedes, renders
them additionally fertile. Its length from its source is 300
miles, to which we must add eighty-eight for its sinuosities;
and it receives from the Apennines and Alps not only several
navigable rivers, but immense lakes as well, which discharge
themselves into its waters, thus conveying altogether as many
as thirty streams into the Adriatic Sea.</p>

<p>Of these the best known are the following—flowing from
the range of the Apennines, the Jactus, the Tanarus<a id="FNanchor_1855" href="#Footnote_1855" class="fnanchor">1855</a>, the
Trebia which passes Placentia, the Tarus, the Incia, the
Gabellus, the Scultenna, and the Rhenus: from the chain of
the Alps, the Stura<a id="FNanchor_1856" href="#Footnote_1856" class="fnanchor">1856</a>, the Orgus, the two Duriæ, the Sessites,
the Ticinus, the Lambrus, the Addua, the Ollius, and the
Mincius. There is no river known to receive a larger increase
than this in so short a space; so much so indeed that it is
impelled onwards by this vast body of water, and, invading
the land<a id="FNanchor_1857" href="#Footnote_1857" class="fnanchor">1857</a>, forms deep channels in its course: hence it is
that, although a portion of its stream is drawn off by rivers
and canals between Ravenna and Altinum, for a space of
120 miles, still, at the spot where it discharges the vast body
of its waters, it is said to form seven seas.</p>

<p>By the Augustan Canal the Padus is carried to Ravenna,
at which place it is called the Padusa<a id="FNanchor_1858" href="#Footnote_1858" class="fnanchor">1858</a>, having formerly borne
the name of Messanicus. The nearest mouth to this spot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
forms the extensive port known as that of Vatrenus, where
Claudius Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_1859" href="#Footnote_1859" class="fnanchor">1859</a>, on his triumph over the Britons, entered
the Adriatic in a vessel that deserved rather the name of a
vast palace than a ship. This mouth, which was formerly
called by some the Eridanian, has been by others styled the
Spinetic mouth, from the city of Spina, a very powerful place
which formerly stood in the vicinity, if we may form a conclusion
from the amount of its treasure deposited at Delphi;
it was founded by Diomedes. At this spot the river Vatrenus<a id="FNanchor_1860" href="#Footnote_1860" class="fnanchor">1860</a>,
which flows from the territory of Forum Cornelî, swells
the waters of the Padus.</p>

<p>The next mouth to this is that of Caprasia<a id="FNanchor_1861" href="#Footnote_1861" class="fnanchor">1861</a>, then that
of Sagis, and then Volane, formerly called Olane; all of
which are situate upon the Flavian Canal<a id="FNanchor_1862" href="#Footnote_1862" class="fnanchor">1862</a>, which the Tuscans
formerly made from Sagis, thus drawing the impetuous
stream of the river across into the marshes of the
Atriani, which they call the Seven Seas; and upon which is
the noble port of Atria<a id="FNanchor_1863" href="#Footnote_1863" class="fnanchor">1863</a>, a city of the Tuscans, from which
place the sea was formerly called the Atriatic, though now
the Adriatic.</p>

<p>We next come to the overflowing mouths of Carbonaria,
and the Fosses of Philistina<a id="FNanchor_1864" href="#Footnote_1864" class="fnanchor">1864</a>, by some called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
Tartarus<a id="FNanchor_1865" href="#Footnote_1865" class="fnanchor">1865</a>, all of which originate in the overflow of the waters in
the Philistinian Canal, swollen by the streams of the Atesis,
descending from the Tridentine Alps, and of the Togisonus<a id="FNanchor_1866" href="#Footnote_1866" class="fnanchor">1866</a>,
flowing from the territory of the Patavini. A portion of them
also forms the adjoining port of Brundulum<a id="FNanchor_1867" href="#Footnote_1867" class="fnanchor">1867</a>, in the same
manner as Edron<a id="FNanchor_1868" href="#Footnote_1868" class="fnanchor">1868</a> is formed by the two rivers Meduacus and
the Clodian Canal. With the waters of these streams the
Padus unites, and with them discharges itself into the sea,
forming, according to most writers, between the Alps and
the sea-shore a triangular figure, 2000 stadia in circumference,
not unlike the Delta formed by the Nile in Egypt.
I feel somewhat ashamed to have to borrow from the Greeks
any statement in reference to Italy; Metrodorus of Scepsos,
however, informs us that this river has obtained its name of
Padus from the fact, that about its source there are great
numbers of pine-trees, which in the Gallic language are
called “padi.” In the tongue of the Ligurians this river is
called “Bodincus,” which signifies “the bottomless.” This
derivation is in some measure supported by the fact that
near this river there is the town of Industria<a id="FNanchor_1869" href="#Footnote_1869" class="fnanchor">1869</a>, of which the
ancient name was Bodincomagum, and where the river begins
to be of greater depth than in other parts.</p>

<p>From the river Padus the eleventh region receives its
name of Transpadana; to which, situate as it is wholly in
the interior, the river, by its bounteous channel, conveys
the gifts of all the seas. The towns are Vibî Forum<a id="FNanchor_1870" href="#Footnote_1870" class="fnanchor">1870</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
Segusio; and, at the foot of the Alps, the colony of Augusta
Taurinorum<a id="FNanchor_1871" href="#Footnote_1871" class="fnanchor">1871</a>, at which place the Padus becomes navigable,
and which was founded by the ancient race of the Ligurians,
and of Augusta Prætoria<a id="FNanchor_1872" href="#Footnote_1872" class="fnanchor">1872</a> of the Salassi, near the two passes
of the Alps, the Grecian<a id="FNanchor_1873" href="#Footnote_1873" class="fnanchor">1873</a> and the Penine (by the latter it is
said that the Carthaginians passed into Italy, by the Grecian,
Hercules)—the town of Eporedia<a id="FNanchor_1874" href="#Footnote_1874" class="fnanchor">1874</a>, the foundation of which
by the Roman people was enjoined by the Sibylline books;
the Gauls call tamers of horses by the name of “Eporediæ”—Vercellæ<a id="FNanchor_1875" href="#Footnote_1875" class="fnanchor">1875</a>,
the town of the Libici, derived its origin
from the Salluvii, and Novaria<a id="FNanchor_1876" href="#Footnote_1876" class="fnanchor">1876</a>, founded by the Vertacomacori,
is at the present day a district of the Vocontii, and not,
as Cato supposes, of the Ligurians; of whom two nations,
called the Lævi and the Marici, founded Ticinum<a id="FNanchor_1877" href="#Footnote_1877" class="fnanchor">1877</a>, not far
from the Padus, as the Boii, descended from the Transalpine
nations, have founded Laus Pompeia<a id="FNanchor_1878" href="#Footnote_1878" class="fnanchor">1878</a> and the Insubres Mediolanum<a id="FNanchor_1879" href="#Footnote_1879" class="fnanchor">1879</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span></p>

<p>From Cato we also learn that Comum, Bergomum<a id="FNanchor_1880" href="#Footnote_1880" class="fnanchor">1880</a>, and
Licinîforum<a id="FNanchor_1881" href="#Footnote_1881" class="fnanchor">1881</a>, and some other peoples in the vicinity, originated
with the Orobii, but he admits that he is ignorant as
to the origin of that nation. Cornelius Alexander however
informs us that they came from Greece, interpreting their
name as meaning “those who live upon the mountains<a id="FNanchor_1882" href="#Footnote_1882" class="fnanchor">1882</a>.”
In this district, Parra has disappeared, a town of the Orobii,
from whom, according to Cato, the people of Bergomum are
descended; its site even yet shows that it was situate in a
position more elevated than fruitful<a id="FNanchor_1883" href="#Footnote_1883" class="fnanchor">1883</a>. The Caturiges have
also perished, an exiled race of the Insubres, as also Spina
previously mentioned; Melpum too, a place distinguished
for its opulence, which, as we are informed by Cornelius
Nepos, was destroyed by the Insubres, the Boii, and the
Senones, on the very day on which Camillus took Veii.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_22">CHAP. 22. (18.)—THE TENTH REGION OF ITALY.</h3></div>

<p>We now come to the tenth region of Italy, situate on the

and a port with the same name, the colony of Concordia<a id="FNanchor_1889" href="#Footnote_1889" class="fnanchor">1889</a>;
the rivers and harbours of Romatinum<a id="FNanchor_1890" href="#Footnote_1890" class="fnanchor">1890</a>, the greater
and less Tiliaventum<a id="FNanchor_1891" href="#Footnote_1891" class="fnanchor">1891</a>, the Anaxum<a id="FNanchor_1892" href="#Footnote_1892" class="fnanchor">1892</a>, into which the Varamus
flows, the Alsa<a id="FNanchor_1893" href="#Footnote_1893" class="fnanchor">1893</a>, and the Natiso with the Turrus, which flow
past the colony of Aquileia<a id="FNanchor_1894" href="#Footnote_1894" class="fnanchor">1894</a> at a distance of fifteen miles
from the sea. This is the country of the Carni<a id="FNanchor_1895" href="#Footnote_1895" class="fnanchor">1895</a>, and adjoining
to it is that of the Iapydes, the river Timavus<a id="FNanchor_1896" href="#Footnote_1896" class="fnanchor">1896</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
fortress of Pucinum<a id="FNanchor_1897" href="#Footnote_1897" class="fnanchor">1897</a>, famous for its wines, the Gulf of Tergeste<a id="FNanchor_1898" href="#Footnote_1898" class="fnanchor">1898</a>,
and the colony of that name, thirty-three miles from
Aquileia. Six miles beyond this place lies the river Formio<a id="FNanchor_1899" href="#Footnote_1899" class="fnanchor">1899</a>,
189 miles distant from Ravenna, the ancient boundary<a id="FNanchor_1900" href="#Footnote_1900" class="fnanchor">1900</a> of
enlarged Italy, and now the frontier of Istria. That this
region takes its name from the river Ister which flows from
the Danube, also called the Ister, into the Adriatic opposite
the mouth of the Padus, and that the sea which lies between
them is rendered fresh by their waters running from opposite
directions, has been erroneously asserted by many, and among
them by Nepos even, who dwelt upon the banks of the Padus.
For it is the fact that no river which runs from the Danube
discharges itself into the Adriatic. They have been misled,
I think, by the circumstance that the ship Argo came down
some river into the Adriatic sea, not far from Tergeste;
but what river that was is now unknown. The most careful
writers say that the ship was carried across the Alps on
men’s shoulders, having passed along the Ister, then along
the Savus, and so from Nauportus<a id="FNanchor_1901" href="#Footnote_1901" class="fnanchor">1901</a>, which place, lying between
Æmona<a id="FNanchor_1902" href="#Footnote_1902" class="fnanchor">1902</a> and the Alps, from that circumstance derives
its name.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_23">CHAP. 23. (19.)—ISTRIA, ITS PEOPLE AND LOCALITY.</h3></div>

<p>Istria projects in the form of a peninsula. Some writers
have stated its length to be forty miles, and its circumference
125; and the same as to Liburnia which adjoins it, and the
Flanatic Gulf<a id="FNanchor_1903" href="#Footnote_1903" class="fnanchor">1903</a>, while others make it 225<a id="FNanchor_1904" href="#Footnote_1904" class="fnanchor">1904</a>; others again
make the circumference of Liburnia 180 miles. Some persons
too extend Iapydia, at the back of Istria, as far as the
Flanatic Gulf, a distance of 130 miles, thus making Liburnia
but 150 miles. Tuditanus<a id="FNanchor_1905" href="#Footnote_1905" class="fnanchor">1905</a>, who subdued the Istri, had this
inscription on his statue which was erected there: “From
Aquileia to the river Titus is a distance of 1000 stadia.”</p>

<p>The towns of Istria with the rights of Roman citizens are
Ægida<a id="FNanchor_1906" href="#Footnote_1906" class="fnanchor">1906</a>, Parentium, and the colony of Pola<a id="FNanchor_1907" href="#Footnote_1907" class="fnanchor">1907</a>, now Pietas Julia,
formerly founded by the Colchians, and distant from Tergeste
100 miles: after which we come to the town of Nesactium<a id="FNanchor_1908" href="#Footnote_1908" class="fnanchor">1908</a>,
and the river Arsia, now<a id="FNanchor_1909" href="#Footnote_1909" class="fnanchor">1909</a> the boundary of Italy.
The distance across from Ancona to Pola is 120 miles. In<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
the interior of the tenth region are the colonies of Cremona,
Brixia in the territory of the Cenomanni<a id="FNanchor_1910" href="#Footnote_1910" class="fnanchor">1910</a>, Ateste<a id="FNanchor_1911" href="#Footnote_1911" class="fnanchor">1911</a> belonging
to the Veneti, and the towns of Acelum<a id="FNanchor_1912" href="#Footnote_1912" class="fnanchor">1912</a>, Patavium<a id="FNanchor_1913" href="#Footnote_1913" class="fnanchor">1913</a>, Opitergium,
Belunum<a id="FNanchor_1914" href="#Footnote_1914" class="fnanchor">1914</a>, and Vicetia; with Mantua<a id="FNanchor_1915" href="#Footnote_1915" class="fnanchor">1915</a>, the only
city of the Tuscans now left beyond the Padus. Cato informs
us that the Veneti are descendants of the Trojans<a id="FNanchor_1916" href="#Footnote_1916" class="fnanchor">1916</a>,
and that the Cenomanni<a id="FNanchor_1917" href="#Footnote_1917" class="fnanchor">1917</a> dwelt among the Volcæ in the vicinity
of Massilia. There are also the towns of the Fertini<a id="FNanchor_1918" href="#Footnote_1918" class="fnanchor">1918</a>,
the Tridentini<a id="FNanchor_1919" href="#Footnote_1919" class="fnanchor">1919</a>, and the Beruenses, belonging to the Rhæti,
Verona<a id="FNanchor_1920" href="#Footnote_1920" class="fnanchor">1920</a>, belonging to the Rhæti and the Euganei, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
Julienses<a id="FNanchor_1921" href="#Footnote_1921" class="fnanchor">1921</a> to the Carni. We then have the following peoples,
whom there is no necessity to particularize with any degree
of exactness, the Alutrenses, the Asseriates, the Flamonienses<a id="FNanchor_1922" href="#Footnote_1922" class="fnanchor">1922</a>
with those surnamed Vanienses, and the others
called Culici, the Forojulienses<a id="FNanchor_1923" href="#Footnote_1923" class="fnanchor">1923</a> surnamed Transpadani, the
Foretani, the Nedinates<a id="FNanchor_1924" href="#Footnote_1924" class="fnanchor">1924</a>, the Quarqueni<a id="FNanchor_1925" href="#Footnote_1925" class="fnanchor">1925</a>, the Taurisani<a id="FNanchor_1926" href="#Footnote_1926" class="fnanchor">1926</a>,
the Togienses, and the Varvari. In this district there have
disappeared—upon the coast—Iramene, Pellaon, and Palsatium,
Atina and Cælina belonging to the Veneti, Segeste
and Ocra to the Carni, and Noreia to the Taurisci. L. Piso
also informs us that although the senate disapproved of his
so doing, M. Claudius Marcellus<a id="FNanchor_1927" href="#Footnote_1927" class="fnanchor">1927</a> razed to the ground a
tower situate at the twelfth mile-stone from Aquileia.</p>

<p>In this region also and the eleventh there are some celebrated
lakes<a id="FNanchor_1928" href="#Footnote_1928" class="fnanchor">1928</a>, and several rivers that either take their rise in
them or else are fed by their waters, in those cases in which
they again emerge from them. These are the Addua<a id="FNanchor_1929" href="#Footnote_1929" class="fnanchor">1929</a>, fed by
the Lake Larius, the Ticinus by Lake Verbannus, the Mincius
by Lake Benacus, the Ollius by Lake Sebinnus, and the Lambrus
by Lake Eupilis—all of them flowing into the Padus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>Cælius states that the length of the Alps from the Upper
Sea to the Lower is 1000 miles, a distance which Timagenes
shortens by twenty-two. Cornelius Nepos assigns to
them a breadth of 100 miles, and T. Livius of 3000 stadia;
but then in different places. For in some localities they
exceed 100 miles; where they divide Germany, for instance,
from Italy; while in other parts they do not reach seventy,
being thus narrowed by the providential dispensation of
nature as it were. The breadth of Italy, taken from the
river Var at the foot of these mountains, and passing along
by the Vada<a id="FNanchor_1930" href="#Footnote_1930" class="fnanchor">1930</a> Sabatia, the Taurini, Comum, Brixia, Verona,
Vicetia, Opitergium, Aquileia, Tergeste, Pola, and Arsia, is
745 miles.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_24">CHAP. 24. (20.)—THE ALPS, AND THE ALPINE NATIONS.</h3></div>

<p>Many nations dwell among the Alps; but the more
remarkable, between Pola and the district of Tergeste, are
the Secusses, the Subocrini, the Catali, the Menocaleni, and
near the Carni the people formerly called the Taurisci, but
now the Norici. Adjoining to these are the Rhæti and the
Vindelici, who are all divided into a multitude of states. It
is supposed that the Rhæti are the descendants of the Tuscans,
who were expelled by the Gauls and migrated hither
under the command of their chief, whose name was Rhætus.
Turning then to the side of the Alps which fronts Italy, we
have the Euganean<a id="FNanchor_1931" href="#Footnote_1931" class="fnanchor">1931</a> nations enjoying Latin rights, and of
whom Cato enumerates thirty-four towns. Among these are
the Triumpilini, a people who were sold<a id="FNanchor_1932" href="#Footnote_1932" class="fnanchor">1932</a> with their territory;
and then the Camuni, and several similar tribes, each
of them in the jurisdiction of its neighbouring municipal
town. The same author also considers the Lepontii<a id="FNanchor_1933" href="#Footnote_1933" class="fnanchor">1933</a> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
the Salassi to be of Tauriscan origin, but most other
writers, giving a Greek<a id="FNanchor_1934" href="#Footnote_1934" class="fnanchor">1934</a> interpretation to their name, consider
the Lepontii to have been those of the followers of
Hercules who were left behind in consequence of their limbs
being frozen by the snow of the Alps. They are also of
opinion that the inhabitants of the Grecian Alps are descended
from a portion of the Greeks of his army, and that
the Euganeans, being sprung from an origin so illustrious,
thence took their name<a id="FNanchor_1935" href="#Footnote_1935" class="fnanchor">1935</a>. The head of these are the Stœni<a id="FNanchor_1936" href="#Footnote_1936" class="fnanchor">1936</a>.
The Vennonenses<a id="FNanchor_1937" href="#Footnote_1937" class="fnanchor">1937</a> and the Sarunetes<a id="FNanchor_1938" href="#Footnote_1938" class="fnanchor">1938</a>, peoples of the
Rhæti, dwell about the sources of the river Rhenus, while
the tribe of the Lepontii, known as the Uberi, dwell in the
vicinity of the sources of the Rhodanus, in the same district
of the Alps. There are also other native tribes here,
who have received Latin rights, such as the Octodurenses<a id="FNanchor_1939" href="#Footnote_1939" class="fnanchor">1939</a>,
and their neighbours the Centrones<a id="FNanchor_1940" href="#Footnote_1940" class="fnanchor">1940</a>, the Cottian<a id="FNanchor_1941" href="#Footnote_1941" class="fnanchor">1941</a> states,
the Ligurian Vagienni, descended from the Caturiges<a id="FNanchor_1942" href="#Footnote_1942" class="fnanchor">1942</a>, as
also those called Montani<a id="FNanchor_1943" href="#Footnote_1943" class="fnanchor">1943</a>; besides numerous nations of the

<p>It may not be inappropriate in this place to subjoin the
inscription now to be seen upon the trophy<a id="FNanchor_1945" href="#Footnote_1945" class="fnanchor">1945</a> erected on the

the seventeenth<a id="FNanchor_1947" href="#Footnote_1947" class="fnanchor">1947</a> year of his holding the tribunitial
authority, the Senate and the Roman people, in
remembrance that under his command and auspices
all the Alpine nations which extended from the
upper sea to the lower were reduced to subjection
by the Roman people—The Alpine nations so subdued
were: the Triumpilini, the Camuni, the Venostes<a id="FNanchor_1948" href="#Footnote_1948" class="fnanchor">1948</a>,
the Vennonenses, the Isarci, the Breuni,

<p>The twelve states of the Cottiani<a id="FNanchor_1955" href="#Footnote_1955" class="fnanchor">1955</a> were not included in
the list, as they had shown no hostility, nor yet those which
had been placed by the Pompeian law under the jurisdiction
of the municipal towns.</p>

<p>Such then is Italy, sacred to the gods, such are the nations,
such the cities of her peoples; to which we may add,
that this is that same Italy, which, when L. Æmilius Paulus<a id="FNanchor_1956" href="#Footnote_1956" class="fnanchor">1956</a>
and C. Attilius Regulus were Consuls, on hearing of the rising
in Gaul, unaided, and without any foreign assistance whatever,
without the help even of that portion which lies beyond the
Padus, armed 80,000 horse and 700,000 foot. In abundance
of metals of every kind Italy yields to no land whatever;
but all search for them has been prohibited by an ancient
decree of the Senate, who gave orders thereby that Italy
shall be exempted<a id="FNanchor_1957" href="#Footnote_1957" class="fnanchor">1957</a> from such treatment.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_25">CHAP. 25. (21.)—LIBURNIA AND ILLYRICUM.</h3></div>

<p>The nation of the Liburni adjoins the river Arsia<a id="FNanchor_1958" href="#Footnote_1958" class="fnanchor">1958</a>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
extends as far as the river Titus. The Mentores, the Hymani<a id="FNanchor_1959" href="#Footnote_1959" class="fnanchor">1959</a>,
the Encheleæ, the Buni, and the people whom Callimachus
calls the Peucetiæ, formerly formed part of it; but now the
whole in general are comprised under the one name of
Illyricum. But few of the names of these nations are worthy
of mention, or indeed very easy of pronunciation. To the
jurisdiction of Scardona<a id="FNanchor_1960" href="#Footnote_1960" class="fnanchor">1960</a> resort the Iapydes and fourteen
cities of the Liburni, of which it may not prove tedious if I
mention the Lacinienses, the Stlupini, the Burnistæ, and
the Olbonenses. Belonging to the same jurisdiction there
are, in the enjoyment of Italian rights, the Alutæ<a id="FNanchor_1961" href="#Footnote_1961" class="fnanchor">1961</a>, the
Flanates<a id="FNanchor_1962" href="#Footnote_1962" class="fnanchor">1962</a>, from whom the Gulf takes its name, the Lopsi,
and the Varvarini; the Assesiates, who are exempt from
tribute; and upon the islands, the Fertinates and the Curictæ<a id="FNanchor_1963" href="#Footnote_1963" class="fnanchor">1963</a>.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are on the coast, after leaving Nesactium,
Alvona<a id="FNanchor_1964" href="#Footnote_1964" class="fnanchor">1964</a>, Flanona, Tarsatica, Senia, Lopsica, Ortopula,
Vegium, Argyruntum, Corinium<a id="FNanchor_1965" href="#Footnote_1965" class="fnanchor">1965</a>, Ænona, the city of
Pasinum, and the river Tedanius, at which Iapydia terminates.
The islands of this Gulf, with their towns, besides
those above mentioned, are Absyrtium<a id="FNanchor_1966" href="#Footnote_1966" class="fnanchor">1966</a>, Arba<a id="FNanchor_1967" href="#Footnote_1967" class="fnanchor">1967</a>, Crexa, Gissa,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
and Portunata. Again, on the mainland there is the colony
of Iadera<a id="FNanchor_1968" href="#Footnote_1968" class="fnanchor">1968</a>, distant from Pola 160 miles; then, at a
distance of thirty miles, the island of Colentum<a id="FNanchor_1969" href="#Footnote_1969" class="fnanchor">1969</a>, and of
eighteen, the mouth of the river Titus.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_26">CHAP. 26. (22.)—DALMATIA.</h3></div>

<p>Scardona, situate upon the river<a id="FNanchor_1970" href="#Footnote_1970" class="fnanchor">1970</a>, at a distance of twelve
miles from the sea, forms the boundary of Liburnia and the
beginning of Dalmatia. Next to this place comes the ancient
country of the Autariatares and the fortress of Tariona, the
Promontory of Diomedes<a id="FNanchor_1971" href="#Footnote_1971" class="fnanchor">1971</a>, or, as others call it, the peninsula
of Hyllis, 100 miles<a id="FNanchor_1972" href="#Footnote_1972" class="fnanchor">1972</a> in circuit. Then comes Tragurium, a
place with the rights of Roman citizens, and celebrated for
its marble, Sicum, a place to which Claudius, the emperor
lately deified, sent a colony of his veterans, and Salona<a id="FNanchor_1973" href="#Footnote_1973" class="fnanchor">1973</a>, a
colony, situate 112 miles from Iadera. To this place resort
for legal purposes, having the laws dispensed according to
their divisions into decuries or tithings, the Dalmatæ, forming
342 decuries, the Deurici 22, the Ditiones 239, the
Mazæi 269, and the Sardiates 52. In this region are Burnum<a id="FNanchor_1974" href="#Footnote_1974" class="fnanchor">1974</a>,
Andetrium<a id="FNanchor_1975" href="#Footnote_1975" class="fnanchor">1975</a>, and Tribulium, fortresses ennobled by
the battles of the Roman people. To the same jurisdiction
also belong the Issæi<a id="FNanchor_1976" href="#Footnote_1976" class="fnanchor">1976</a>, the Colentini, the Separi, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
Epetini, nations inhabiting the islands. After these come
the fortresses of Peguntium<a id="FNanchor_1977" href="#Footnote_1977" class="fnanchor">1977</a> and of Rataneum, with the
colony of Narona<a id="FNanchor_1978" href="#Footnote_1978" class="fnanchor">1978</a>, the seat of the third jurisdiction, distant
from Salona eighty-two miles, and situate upon a river of the
same name, at a distance of twenty miles from the sea. M.
Varro states that eighty-nine states used to resort thither, but
now nearly the only ones that are known are the Cerauni<a id="FNanchor_1979" href="#Footnote_1979" class="fnanchor">1979</a>
with 24 decuries, the Daorizi with 17, the Dæsitiates with 103,
the Docleatæ with 33, the Deretini with 14, the Deremistæ
with 30, the Dindari with 33, the Glinditiones with 44, the
Melcomani with 24, the Naresii with 102, the Scirtarii with
72, the Siculotæ with 24, and the Vardæi, once the scourges
of Italy, with no more than 20 decuries. In addition to
these, this district was possessed by the Ozuæi, the Partheni,
the Hemasini, the Arthitæ, and the Armistæ. The colony
of Epidaurum<a id="FNanchor_1980" href="#Footnote_1980" class="fnanchor">1980</a> is distant from the river Naron 100 miles.
After Epidaurum come the following towns, with the rights
of Roman citizens:—Rhizinium<a id="FNanchor_1981" href="#Footnote_1981" class="fnanchor">1981</a>, Acruvium<a id="FNanchor_1982" href="#Footnote_1982" class="fnanchor">1982</a>, Butua, Olcinium,
formerly called Colchinium, having been founded by
the Colchians; the river Drilo<a id="FNanchor_1983" href="#Footnote_1983" class="fnanchor">1983</a>, and, upon it, Scodra<a id="FNanchor_1984" href="#Footnote_1984" class="fnanchor">1984</a>, a
town with the rights of Roman citizens, situate at a distance
of eighteen miles from the sea; besides in former times many
Greek towns and once powerful states, of which all remembrance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
is fast fading away. For in this region there were
formerly the Labeatæ, the Enderini<a id="FNanchor_1985" href="#Footnote_1985" class="fnanchor">1985</a>, the Sasæi, the Grabæi<a id="FNanchor_1986" href="#Footnote_1986" class="fnanchor">1986</a>,
properly called Illyrii, the Taulantii<a id="FNanchor_1987" href="#Footnote_1987" class="fnanchor">1987</a>, and the Pyræi. The
Promontory of Nymphæum on the sea-coast still retains its
name<a id="FNanchor_1988" href="#Footnote_1988" class="fnanchor">1988</a>; and there is Lissum, a town enjoying the rights of
Roman citizens, at a distance from Epidaurum of 100 miles.</p>

<p>(23.) At Lissum begins the province of Macedonia<a id="FNanchor_1989" href="#Footnote_1989" class="fnanchor">1989</a>, the
nations of the Parthini<a id="FNanchor_1990" href="#Footnote_1990" class="fnanchor">1990</a>, and behind them the Dassaretæ<a id="FNanchor_1991" href="#Footnote_1991" class="fnanchor">1991</a>.
The mountains of Candavia<a id="FNanchor_1992" href="#Footnote_1992" class="fnanchor">1992</a> are seventy-eight miles from
Dyrrhachium. On the coast lies Denda, a town with the
rights of Roman citizens, the colony of Epidamnum<a id="FNanchor_1993" href="#Footnote_1993" class="fnanchor">1993</a>, which,
on account of its inauspicious name, was by the Romans
called Dyrrhachium, the river Aöus<a id="FNanchor_1994" href="#Footnote_1994" class="fnanchor">1994</a>, by some called Æas,
and Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_1995" href="#Footnote_1995" class="fnanchor">1995</a>, formerly a colony of the Corinthians, at a
distance of four miles from the sea, in the vicinity of which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
the celebrated Nymphæum<a id="FNanchor_1996" href="#Footnote_1996" class="fnanchor">1996</a> is inhabited by the barbarous
Amantes<a id="FNanchor_1997" href="#Footnote_1997" class="fnanchor">1997</a> and Buliones. Upon the coast too is the town of
Oricum<a id="FNanchor_1998" href="#Footnote_1998" class="fnanchor">1998</a>, founded by the Colchians. At this spot begins
Epirus, with the Acroceraunian<a id="FNanchor_1999" href="#Footnote_1999" class="fnanchor">1999</a> mountains, by which we have
previously mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2000" href="#Footnote_2000" class="fnanchor">2000</a> this Gulf of Europe as bounded.
Oricum is distant from the Promontory of Salentinum in
Italy eighty<a id="FNanchor_2001" href="#Footnote_2001" class="fnanchor">2001</a> miles.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_27">CHAP. 27. (24.)—THE NORICI.</h3></div>

<p>In the rear of the Carni and the Iapydes, along the course
of the great river Ister<a id="FNanchor_2002" href="#Footnote_2002" class="fnanchor">2002</a>, the Rhæti touch upon the Norici<a id="FNanchor_2003" href="#Footnote_2003" class="fnanchor">2003</a>:
their towns are Virunum<a id="FNanchor_2004" href="#Footnote_2004" class="fnanchor">2004</a>, Celeia, Teurnia, Aguntum<a id="FNanchor_2005" href="#Footnote_2005" class="fnanchor">2005</a>,

the Boii<a id="FNanchor_2010" href="#Footnote_2010" class="fnanchor">2010</a>; they are however now inhabited by the people

and the town of Scarabantia Julia<a id="FNanchor_2012" href="#Footnote_2012" class="fnanchor">2012</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_28">CHAP. 28. (25.)—PANNONIA.</h3></div>

<p>Next to them comes acorn-bearing Pannonia<a id="FNanchor_2013" href="#Footnote_2013" class="fnanchor">2013</a>, along
which the chain of the Alps, gradually lessening as it runs
through the middle of Illyricum from north to south, forms
a gentle slope on the right hand and the left. The portion
which looks towards the Adriatic Sea is called Dalmatia
and Illyricum, above mentioned, while Pannonia stretches
away towards the north, and has the Danube for its extreme
boundary. In it are the colonies of Æmona<a id="FNanchor_2014" href="#Footnote_2014" class="fnanchor">2014</a> and Siscia.
The following rivers, both known to fame and adapted for
commerce, flow into the Danube; the Draus<a id="FNanchor_2015" href="#Footnote_2015" class="fnanchor">2015</a>, which rushes
from Noricum with great impetuosity, and the Savus<a id="FNanchor_2016" href="#Footnote_2016" class="fnanchor">2016</a>, which
flows with a more gentle current from the Carnic Alps, there
being a space between them of 120 miles. The Draus runs
through the Serretes, the Serrapilli<a id="FNanchor_2017" href="#Footnote_2017" class="fnanchor">2017</a>, the Iasi, and the Andizetes;
the Savus through the Colapiani<a id="FNanchor_2018" href="#Footnote_2018" class="fnanchor">2018</a> and the Breuci;
these are the principal peoples. Besides them there are
the Arivates, the Azali, the Amantini, the Belgites, the
Catari, the Cornacates, the Eravisci, the Hercuniates<a id="FNanchor_2019" href="#Footnote_2019" class="fnanchor">2019</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
Latovici, the Oseriates, the Varciani, and, in front of Mount
Claudius, the Scordisci, behind it the Taurisci. In the Savus
there is the island of Metubarris<a id="FNanchor_2020" href="#Footnote_2020" class="fnanchor">2020</a>, the greatest of all the
islands formed by rivers. Besides the above, there are
these other rivers worthy of mention:—the Colapis<a id="FNanchor_2021" href="#Footnote_2021" class="fnanchor">2021</a>, which
flows into the Savus near Siscia, where, dividing its channel,
it forms the island which is called Segestica<a id="FNanchor_2022" href="#Footnote_2022" class="fnanchor">2022</a>; and the river
Bacuntius<a id="FNanchor_2023" href="#Footnote_2023" class="fnanchor">2023</a>, which flows into the Savus at the town of Sirmium,
where we find the state of the Sirmienses and the
Amantini. Forty-five miles thence is Taurunum<a id="FNanchor_2024" href="#Footnote_2024" class="fnanchor">2024</a>, where
the Savus flows into the Danube; above which spot the
Valdanus<a id="FNanchor_2025" href="#Footnote_2025" class="fnanchor">2025</a> and the Urpanus, themselves far from ignoble
rivers, join that stream.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_29">CHAP. 29. (26.)—MŒSIA.</h3></div>

<p>Joining up to Pannonia is the province called Mœsia<a id="FNanchor_2026" href="#Footnote_2026" class="fnanchor">2026</a>, which
runs, with the course of the Danube, as far as the Euxine.
It commences at the confluence<a id="FNanchor_2027" href="#Footnote_2027" class="fnanchor">2027</a> previously mentioned. In it
are the Dardani, the Celegeri, the Triballi, the Timachi, the
Mœsi, the Thracians, and the Scythians who border on the Euxine.
The more famous among its rivers are the Margis<a id="FNanchor_2028" href="#Footnote_2028" class="fnanchor">2028</a>, which
rises in the territory of the Dardani, the Pingus, the Timachus,
the Œscus which rises in Mount Rhodope, and, rising
in Mount Hæmus, the Utus<a id="FNanchor_2029" href="#Footnote_2029" class="fnanchor">2029</a>, the Asamus, and the Ieterus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>The breadth of Illyricum<a id="FNanchor_2030" href="#Footnote_2030" class="fnanchor">2030</a> at its widest part is 325 miles,
and its length from the river Arsia to the river Drinius
530; from the Drinius to the Promontory of Acroceraunia
Agrippa states to be 175 miles, and he says that the entire
circuit of the Italian and Illyrian Gulf is 1700 miles. In
this Gulf, according to the limits which we have drawn,
are two seas, the Ionian<a id="FNanchor_2031" href="#Footnote_2031" class="fnanchor">2031</a> in the first part, and the Adriatic,
which runs more inland and is called the Upper Sea.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_III_CHAP_30">CHAP. 30.—ISLANDS OF THE IONIAN SEA AND THE ADRIATIC.</h3></div>

<p>In the Ausonian Sea there are no islands worthy of
notice beyond those which we have already mentioned, and
only a few in the Ionian; those, for instance, upon the Calabrian
coast, opposite Brundusium, by the projection of which
a harbour is formed; and, over against the Apulian coast,
Diomedia<a id="FNanchor_2032" href="#Footnote_2032" class="fnanchor">2032</a>, remarkable for the monument of Diomedes, and
another island called by the same name, but by some Teutria.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<p>The coast of Illyricum is clustered with more than 1000
islands, the sea being of a shoaly nature, and numerous
creeks and æstuaries running with their narrow channels
between portions of the land. The more famous are those
before the mouths of the Timavus, with warm springs<a id="FNanchor_2033" href="#Footnote_2033" class="fnanchor">2033</a> that
rise with the tides of the sea, the island of Cissa near the
territory of the Istri, and the Pullaria<a id="FNanchor_2034" href="#Footnote_2034" class="fnanchor">2034</a> and Absyrtides<a id="FNanchor_2035" href="#Footnote_2035" class="fnanchor">2035</a>, so
called by the Greeks from the circumstance of Absyrtus,
the brother of Medea, having been slain there. Some islands
near them have been called the Electrides<a id="FNanchor_2036" href="#Footnote_2036" class="fnanchor">2036</a>, upon which
amber, which they call “electrum,” was said to be found;
a most assured instance however of that untruthfulness<a id="FNanchor_2037" href="#Footnote_2037" class="fnanchor">2037</a>
which is generally ascribed to the Greeks, seeing
that it has never yet been ascertained which of the islands
were meant by them under that name. Opposite to the Iader
is Lissa, and other islands whose names have been already
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2038" href="#Footnote_2038" class="fnanchor">2038</a>. Opposite to the Liburni are some islands
called the Crateæ, and no smaller number styled Liburnicæ
and Celadussæ<a id="FNanchor_2039" href="#Footnote_2039" class="fnanchor">2039</a>. Opposite to Surium is Bavo, and Brattia<a id="FNanchor_2040" href="#Footnote_2040" class="fnanchor">2040</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
famous for its goats, Issa with the rights of Roman citizens,
and Pharia with a town. At a distance of twenty-five miles
from Issa is Corcyra<a id="FNanchor_2041" href="#Footnote_2041" class="fnanchor">2041</a>, surnamed Melæna, with a town founded
by the Cnidians; between which and Illyricum is Melite<a id="FNanchor_2042" href="#Footnote_2042" class="fnanchor">2042</a>,
from which, as we learn from Callimachus, a certain kind
of little dogs were called Melitæi; fifteen miles from it we
find the seven Elaphites<a id="FNanchor_2043" href="#Footnote_2043" class="fnanchor">2043</a>. In the Ionian Sea, at a distance
of twelve miles from Oricum, is Sasonis<a id="FNanchor_2044" href="#Footnote_2044" class="fnanchor">2044</a>, notorious from
having been a harbour of pirates.</p>

<p>The third great Gulf of Europe begins at the mountains
of Acroceraunia<a id="FNanchor_2083" href="#Footnote_2083" class="fnanchor">2083</a>, and ends at the Hellespont, embracing an
extent of 2500 miles, exclusive of the sea-line of nineteen
smaller gulfs. Upon it are Epirus, Acarnania, Ætolia, Phocis,
Locris, Achaia, Messenia, Laconia, Argolis, Megaris, Attica,
Bœotia; and again, upon the other sea<a id="FNanchor_2084" href="#Footnote_2084" class="fnanchor">2084</a>, the same Phocis
and Locris, Doris, Phthiotis, Thessalia, Magnesia, Macedonia
and Thracia. All the fabulous lore of Greece, as well as the
effulgence of her literature, first shone forth upon the banks
of this Gulf. We shall therefore dwell a little the longer
upon it.</p>

<p>Epirus<a id="FNanchor_2085" href="#Footnote_2085" class="fnanchor">2085</a>, generally so called, begins at the mountains of
Acroceraunia. The first people that we meet are the Chaones,
from whom Chaonia<a id="FNanchor_2086" href="#Footnote_2086" class="fnanchor">2086</a> receives its name, then the Thesproti<a id="FNanchor_2087" href="#Footnote_2087" class="fnanchor">2087</a>,
and then the Antigonenses<a id="FNanchor_2088" href="#Footnote_2088" class="fnanchor">2088</a>. We then come to the place
where Aornos<a id="FNanchor_2089" href="#Footnote_2089" class="fnanchor">2089</a> stood, with its exhalations so deadly to the
feathered race, the Cestrini<a id="FNanchor_2090" href="#Footnote_2090" class="fnanchor">2090</a>, the Perrhæbi<a id="FNanchor_2091" href="#Footnote_2091" class="fnanchor">2091</a>, in whose country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
Mount Pindus is situate, the Cassiopæi<a id="FNanchor_2092" href="#Footnote_2092" class="fnanchor">2092</a>, the Dryopes<a id="FNanchor_2093" href="#Footnote_2093" class="fnanchor">2093</a>,
the Sellæ<a id="FNanchor_2094" href="#Footnote_2094" class="fnanchor">2094</a>, the Hellopes<a id="FNanchor_2095" href="#Footnote_2095" class="fnanchor">2095</a>, the Molossi, in whose territory is
the temple of the Dodonæan Jupiter, so famous for its oracle;
and Mount Tomarus<a id="FNanchor_2096" href="#Footnote_2096" class="fnanchor">2096</a>, so highly praised by Theopompus,
with its hundred springs gushing from its foot.</p>

<p>(2.) Epirus, properly so called, advances towards Magnesia
and Macedonia, having at its back the Dassaretæ,
previously<a id="FNanchor_2097" href="#Footnote_2097" class="fnanchor">2097</a> mentioned, a free nation, and after them the
Dardani, a savage race. On the left hand, before the Dardani
are extended the Triballi and the nations of Mœsia, while in
front of them the Medi and the Denselatæ join, and next to
them the Thracians, who stretch away as far as the Euxine:
in such a manner is a rampart raised around the lofty heights
of Rhodope, and then of Hæmus.</p>

<p>On the coast of Epirus is the fortress of Chimæra<a id="FNanchor_2098" href="#Footnote_2098" class="fnanchor">2098</a>,
situate upon the Acroceraunian range, and below it the
spring known as the Royal Waters<a id="FNanchor_2099" href="#Footnote_2099" class="fnanchor">2099</a>; then the towns of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
Mæandria, and Cestria<a id="FNanchor_2100" href="#Footnote_2100" class="fnanchor">2100</a>, the Thyamis<a id="FNanchor_2101" href="#Footnote_2101" class="fnanchor">2101</a>, a river of Thesprotia,
the colony of Buthrotum<a id="FNanchor_2102" href="#Footnote_2102" class="fnanchor">2102</a>, and the Ambracian Gulf<a id="FNanchor_2103" href="#Footnote_2103" class="fnanchor">2103</a>, so
famed in history; which, with an inlet only half a mile in
width, receives a vast body of water from the sea, being
thirty-seven miles in length, and fifteen in width. The river
Acheron, which runs through Acherusia, a lake of Thesprotia,
flows into it<a id="FNanchor_2104" href="#Footnote_2104" class="fnanchor">2104</a> after a course of thirty-six miles; it is considered
wonderful for its bridge, 1000 feet in length, by a
people who look upon everything as wonderful that belongs
to themselves. Upon this Gulf is also situate the town of
Ambracia. There are also the Aphas and the Arachthus<a id="FNanchor_2105" href="#Footnote_2105" class="fnanchor">2105</a>,
rivers of the Molossi; the city of Anactoria<a id="FNanchor_2106" href="#Footnote_2106" class="fnanchor">2106</a>, and the place
where Pandosia<a id="FNanchor_2107" href="#Footnote_2107" class="fnanchor">2107</a> stood.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_2">CHAP. 2.—ACARNANIA.</h3></div>

<p>The towns of Acarnania<a id="FNanchor_2108" href="#Footnote_2108" class="fnanchor">2108</a>, the ancient name of which was
Curetis, are Heraclia<a id="FNanchor_2109" href="#Footnote_2109" class="fnanchor">2109</a>, Echinus<a id="FNanchor_2110" href="#Footnote_2110" class="fnanchor">2110</a>, and, on the coast, Actium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
a colony founded by Augustus, with its famous temple of
Apollo and the free city of Nicopolis<a id="FNanchor_2111" href="#Footnote_2111" class="fnanchor">2111</a>. Passing out of the
Ambracian Gulf into the Ionian Sea, we come to the coast
of Leucadia, with the Promontory of Leucate<a id="FNanchor_2112" href="#Footnote_2112" class="fnanchor">2112</a>, and then the
Gulf and the peninsula of Leucadia<a id="FNanchor_2113" href="#Footnote_2113" class="fnanchor">2113</a>, which last was formerly
called Neritis<a id="FNanchor_2114" href="#Footnote_2114" class="fnanchor">2114</a>. By the exertions of the inhabitants it was
once cut off from the mainland, but was again joined to it
by the vast bodies of sand accumulated through the action
of the winds. This spot is called Dioryctos<a id="FNanchor_2115" href="#Footnote_2115" class="fnanchor">2115</a>, and is three
stadia in length: on the peninsula is the town of Leucas,
formerly called Neritus<a id="FNanchor_2116" href="#Footnote_2116" class="fnanchor">2116</a>. We next come to Alyzia<a id="FNanchor_2117" href="#Footnote_2117" class="fnanchor">2117</a>, Stratos<a id="FNanchor_2118" href="#Footnote_2118" class="fnanchor">2118</a>,
and Argos<a id="FNanchor_2119" href="#Footnote_2119" class="fnanchor">2119</a>, surnamed Amphilochian, cities of the
Acarnanians: the river Acheloüs<a id="FNanchor_2120" href="#Footnote_2120" class="fnanchor">2120</a> flows from the heights
of Pindus, and, after separating Acarnania from Ætolia, is
fast adding the island of Artemita<a id="FNanchor_2121" href="#Footnote_2121" class="fnanchor">2121</a> to the mainland by the
continual deposits of earth which it brings down its stream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_3">CHAP. 3. (2.)—ÆTOLIA.</h3></div>

<p>The peoples of Ætolia are the Athamanes<a id="FNanchor_2122" href="#Footnote_2122" class="fnanchor">2122</a>, the Tymphæi<a id="FNanchor_2123" href="#Footnote_2123" class="fnanchor">2123</a>,
the Ephyri<a id="FNanchor_2124" href="#Footnote_2124" class="fnanchor">2124</a>, the Ænienses, the Perrhæbi<a id="FNanchor_2125" href="#Footnote_2125" class="fnanchor">2125</a>, the Dolopes<a id="FNanchor_2126" href="#Footnote_2126" class="fnanchor">2126</a>, the
Maraces, and the Atraces<a id="FNanchor_2127" href="#Footnote_2127" class="fnanchor">2127</a>, in whose territory rises the river
Atrax, which flows into the Ionian Sea. Calydon<a id="FNanchor_2128" href="#Footnote_2128" class="fnanchor">2128</a> is a city
of Ætolia, situate at a distance of seven miles from the sea,
and near the banks of the river Evenus<a id="FNanchor_2129" href="#Footnote_2129" class="fnanchor">2129</a>. We then come to
Macynia<a id="FNanchor_2130" href="#Footnote_2130" class="fnanchor">2130</a>, and Molycria, behind which lie Mounts Chalcis<a id="FNanchor_2131" href="#Footnote_2131" class="fnanchor">2131</a>
and Taphiassus. On the coast again, there is the promontory
of Antirrhium<a id="FNanchor_2132" href="#Footnote_2132" class="fnanchor">2132</a>, off which is the mouth of the Corinthian
Gulf, which flows in and separates Ætolia from the Peloponnesus,
being less<a id="FNanchor_2133" href="#Footnote_2133" class="fnanchor">2133</a> than one mile in width. The promontory
which faces it on the opposite side is called Rhion<a id="FNanchor_2134" href="#Footnote_2134" class="fnanchor">2134</a>. The
towns of Ætolia, however, on the Corinthian Gulf are Naupactus<a id="FNanchor_2135" href="#Footnote_2135" class="fnanchor">2135</a>
and Pylene<a id="FNanchor_2136" href="#Footnote_2136" class="fnanchor">2136</a>; and, more inland, Pleuron and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Halicyrna<a id="FNanchor_2137" href="#Footnote_2137" class="fnanchor">2137</a>. The most famous mountains are Tomarus, in the
district of Dodona, Crania<a id="FNanchor_2138" href="#Footnote_2138" class="fnanchor">2138</a> in Ambracia, Aracynthus<a id="FNanchor_2139" href="#Footnote_2139" class="fnanchor">2139</a> in
Acarnania, and Acanthon<a id="FNanchor_2140" href="#Footnote_2140" class="fnanchor">2140</a>, Panætolium<a id="FNanchor_2141" href="#Footnote_2141" class="fnanchor">2141</a>, and Macynium<a id="FNanchor_2142" href="#Footnote_2142" class="fnanchor">2142</a>, in
Ætolia.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_4">CHAP. 4. (3.)—LOCRIS AND PHOCIS.</h3></div>

<p>Next to Ætolia are the Locri<a id="FNanchor_2143" href="#Footnote_2143" class="fnanchor">2143</a>, surnamed Ozolæ; a people
exempt from tribute. Here is the town of Œanthe<a id="FNanchor_2144" href="#Footnote_2144" class="fnanchor">2144</a>,
the port<a id="FNanchor_2145" href="#Footnote_2145" class="fnanchor">2145</a> of Apollo Phæstius, and the Gulf of Crissa<a id="FNanchor_2146" href="#Footnote_2146" class="fnanchor">2146</a>. In
the interior are the towns of Argyna, Eupalia<a id="FNanchor_2147" href="#Footnote_2147" class="fnanchor">2147</a>, Phæstum,
and Calamisus. Beyond are the Cirrhæan plains of Phocis,
the town of Cirrha<a id="FNanchor_2148" href="#Footnote_2148" class="fnanchor">2148</a>, and the port of Chalæon<a id="FNanchor_2149" href="#Footnote_2149" class="fnanchor">2149</a>, seven miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
from which, in the interior, is situate the free town of Delphi<a id="FNanchor_2150" href="#Footnote_2150" class="fnanchor">2150</a>,
at the foot of Mount Parnassus<a id="FNanchor_2151" href="#Footnote_2151" class="fnanchor">2151</a>, and having the most celebrated
oracle of Apollo throughout the whole world. There is
the Fountain too of Castalia<a id="FNanchor_2152" href="#Footnote_2152" class="fnanchor">2152</a>, and the river Cephisus<a id="FNanchor_2153" href="#Footnote_2153" class="fnanchor">2153</a> which
flows past Delphi, rising in the former city of Lilæa<a id="FNanchor_2154" href="#Footnote_2154" class="fnanchor">2154</a>. Besides
these, there is the town of Crissa<a id="FNanchor_2155" href="#Footnote_2155" class="fnanchor">2155</a> and that of Anticyra<a id="FNanchor_2156" href="#Footnote_2156" class="fnanchor">2156</a>, with
the Bulenses<a id="FNanchor_2157" href="#Footnote_2157" class="fnanchor">2157</a>; as also Naulochum<a id="FNanchor_2158" href="#Footnote_2158" class="fnanchor">2158</a>, Pyrrha, Amphissa<a id="FNanchor_2159" href="#Footnote_2159" class="fnanchor">2159</a>,
exempt from all tribute, Tithrone, Tritea<a id="FNanchor_2160" href="#Footnote_2160" class="fnanchor">2160</a>, Ambrysus<a id="FNanchor_2161" href="#Footnote_2161" class="fnanchor">2161</a>, and
Drymæa<a id="FNanchor_2162" href="#Footnote_2162" class="fnanchor">2162</a>, which district has also the name of Daulis. The
extremity of the gulf washes one corner of Bœotia, with its
towns of Siphæ<a id="FNanchor_2163" href="#Footnote_2163" class="fnanchor">2163</a> and Thebes<a id="FNanchor_2164" href="#Footnote_2164" class="fnanchor">2164</a>, surnamed the Corsian, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
vicinity of Helicon<a id="FNanchor_2165" href="#Footnote_2165" class="fnanchor">2165</a>. The third town of Bœotia on this
sea is that of Pagæ<a id="FNanchor_2166" href="#Footnote_2166" class="fnanchor">2166</a>, from which point the Isthmus of the
Peloponnesus projects in the form of a neck.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_5">CHAP. 5. (4.)—THE PELOPONNESUS.</h3></div>

<p>The Peloponnesus, which was formerly called Apia<a id="FNanchor_2167" href="#Footnote_2167" class="fnanchor">2167</a> and
Pelasgia, is a peninsula, inferior in fame to no land upon the
face of the earth. Situate between the two seas, the Ægean
and the Ionian, it is in shape like the leaf of a plane-tree, in
consequence of the angular indentations made in its shores.
According to Isidorus, it is 563 miles in circumference; and
nearly as much again, allowing for the sea-line on the
margin of its gulfs. The narrow pass at which it commences
is known by the name of the Isthmus. At this spot the two
seas, which we have previously mentioned, running from the
north and the east, invade the land from opposite sides<a id="FNanchor_2168" href="#Footnote_2168" class="fnanchor">2168</a>,
and swallow up its entire breadth, the result being that
through these inroads in opposite directions of such vast
bodies of water, the sides of the land are eaten away to such
an extent, that Hellas<a id="FNanchor_2169" href="#Footnote_2169" class="fnanchor">2169</a> only holds on to the Peloponnesus
by the narrow neck, five miles in width, which intervenes.
The Gulfs thus formed, the one on this side, the other on
that, are known as the Corinthian<a id="FNanchor_2170" href="#Footnote_2170" class="fnanchor">2170</a> and the Saronic Gulfs.
The ports of Lecheæ<a id="FNanchor_2171" href="#Footnote_2171" class="fnanchor">2171</a>, on the one side, and of Cenchreæ on
the other, form the frontiers of this narrow passage, which
thus compels to a tedious and perilous circumnavigation
such vessels as from their magnitude cannot be carried across
by land on vehicles. For this reason it is that both King<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
Demetrius<a id="FNanchor_2172" href="#Footnote_2172" class="fnanchor">2172</a>, Cæsar the Dictator, the prince Caius<a id="FNanchor_2173" href="#Footnote_2173" class="fnanchor">2173</a>, and Domitius
Nero<a id="FNanchor_2174" href="#Footnote_2174" class="fnanchor">2174</a>, have at different times made the attempt to
cut through this neck by forming a navigable canal; a profane
design, as may be clearly seen by the result<a id="FNanchor_2175" href="#Footnote_2175" class="fnanchor">2175</a> in every
one of these instances.</p>

<p>Upon the middle of this intervening neck which we have
called the Isthmus, stands the colony of Corinth, formerly
known by the name of Ephyre<a id="FNanchor_2176" href="#Footnote_2176" class="fnanchor">2176</a>, situate upon the brow of a
hill, at a distance of sixty stadia from the shore of either
sea. From the heights of its citadel, which is called Acrocorinthos,
or the “Heights of Corinth,” and in which is the
Fountain of Pirene, it looks down upon the two seas which
lie in the opposite directions. From Leucas to Patræ upon
the Corinthian gulf is a distance of eighty-eight miles. The
colony of Patræ<a id="FNanchor_2177" href="#Footnote_2177" class="fnanchor">2177</a> is founded upon the most extensive promontory
of the Peloponnesus, facing Ætolia and the river
Evenus, the Corinthian Gulf being, as we have previously<a id="FNanchor_2178" href="#Footnote_2178" class="fnanchor">2178</a>
stated, less than a mile in width at the entrance there,
though extending in length as far as the isthmus, a distance
of eighty-five miles.</p>

<div class="section">
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_6">CHAP. 6. (5.)—ACHAIA.</h3></div>

<p>The province called Achaia<a id="FNanchor_2179" href="#Footnote_2179" class="fnanchor">2179</a> begins at the Isthmus; from
the circumstance of its cities being ranged in regular succession
on its coast, it formerly had the name of Ægialos<a id="FNanchor_2180" href="#Footnote_2180" class="fnanchor">2180</a>.
The first place there is Lecheæ, already mentioned, a port of
the Corinthians; next to which is Olyros<a id="FNanchor_2181" href="#Footnote_2181" class="fnanchor">2181</a>, a fortress of the
people of Pellene<a id="FNanchor_2182" href="#Footnote_2182" class="fnanchor">2182</a>; then the former towns of Helice and
Bura<a id="FNanchor_2183" href="#Footnote_2183" class="fnanchor">2183</a>, and the places in which their inhabitants took refuge
after their towns had been swallowed up by the sea, Sicyon<a id="FNanchor_2184" href="#Footnote_2184" class="fnanchor">2184</a>
namely, Ægira<a id="FNanchor_2185" href="#Footnote_2185" class="fnanchor">2185</a>, Ægium, and Erineos<a id="FNanchor_2186" href="#Footnote_2186" class="fnanchor">2186</a>. In the interior are
Cleonæ and Hysiæ<a id="FNanchor_2187" href="#Footnote_2187" class="fnanchor">2187</a>; then come the port of Panormus<a id="FNanchor_2188" href="#Footnote_2188" class="fnanchor">2188</a>, and
Rhium already mentioned; from which promontory, Patræ,
of which we have previously spoken, is distant five miles; and
then the place where Pheræ<a id="FNanchor_2189" href="#Footnote_2189" class="fnanchor">2189</a> stood. Of the nine mountains
of Achaia, Scioessa is the most famous; there is also the
Fountain of Cymothoë. Beyond Patræ we find the town of
Olenum<a id="FNanchor_2190" href="#Footnote_2190" class="fnanchor">2190</a>, the colony of Dyme<a id="FNanchor_2191" href="#Footnote_2191" class="fnanchor">2191</a>, the places where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
Buprasium<a id="FNanchor_2192" href="#Footnote_2192" class="fnanchor">2192</a> and Hyrmine once stood, the Promontory of Araxus<a id="FNanchor_2193" href="#Footnote_2193" class="fnanchor">2193</a>,
the Bay of Cyllene, and the Promontory of Chelonates, at five
miles’ distance from Cyllene<a id="FNanchor_2194" href="#Footnote_2194" class="fnanchor">2194</a>. There is also the fortress of
Phlius<a id="FNanchor_2195" href="#Footnote_2195" class="fnanchor">2195</a>; the district around which was called by Homer
Aræthyrea<a id="FNanchor_2196" href="#Footnote_2196" class="fnanchor">2196</a>, and, after his time, Asopis.</p>

<p>The territory of the Eleans then begins, who were formerly
called Epei, with the city of Elis<a id="FNanchor_2197" href="#Footnote_2197" class="fnanchor">2197</a> in the interior, and, at a
distance of twelve miles from Phlius, being also in the interior,
the temple of Olympian Jupiter, which by the universal
celebrity of its games, gives to Greece its mode of
reckoning<a id="FNanchor_2198" href="#Footnote_2198" class="fnanchor">2198</a>. Here too once stood the town of Pisa<a id="FNanchor_2199" href="#Footnote_2199" class="fnanchor">2199</a>, the river
Alpheus flowing past it. On the coast there is the Promontory
of Ichthys<a id="FNanchor_2200" href="#Footnote_2200" class="fnanchor">2200</a>. The river Alpheus is navigable six miles,
nearly as far as the towns of Aulon<a id="FNanchor_2201" href="#Footnote_2201" class="fnanchor">2201</a> and Leprion. We next
come to the Promontory of Platanodes<a id="FNanchor_2202" href="#Footnote_2202" class="fnanchor">2202</a>. All these localities
lie to the west.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_7">CHAP. 7.—MESSENIA.</h3></div>

<p>Further south is the Gulf of Cyparissus, with the city of
Cyparissa<a id="FNanchor_2203" href="#Footnote_2203" class="fnanchor">2203</a> on its shores, the line of which is seventy-two
miles in length. Then, the towns of Pylos<a id="FNanchor_2204" href="#Footnote_2204" class="fnanchor">2204</a> and Methone<a id="FNanchor_2205" href="#Footnote_2205" class="fnanchor">2205</a>,
the place where Helos stood, the Promontory of Acritas<a id="FNanchor_2206" href="#Footnote_2206" class="fnanchor">2206</a>,
the Asinæan Gulf, which takes its name from the town of
Asine<a id="FNanchor_2207" href="#Footnote_2207" class="fnanchor">2207</a>, and the Coronean, so called from Corone; which gulfs
terminate at the Promontory of Tænarum<a id="FNanchor_2208" href="#Footnote_2208" class="fnanchor">2208</a>. These are all in
the country of Messenia, which has eighteen mountains, and
the river Pamisus<a id="FNanchor_2209" href="#Footnote_2209" class="fnanchor">2209</a> also. In the interior are Messene<a id="FNanchor_2210" href="#Footnote_2210" class="fnanchor">2210</a>, Ithome,
Œchalia, Arene<a id="FNanchor_2211" href="#Footnote_2211" class="fnanchor">2211</a>, Pteleon, Thryon, Dorion<a id="FNanchor_2212" href="#Footnote_2212" class="fnanchor">2212</a>, and Zancle<a id="FNanchor_2213" href="#Footnote_2213" class="fnanchor">2213</a>,
all of them known to fame at different periods. The margin
of this gulf measures eighty miles, the distance across being
thirty.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_8">CHAP. 8.—LACONIA.</h3></div>

<p>At Tænarum begins the territory of Laconia, inhabited by
a free nation, and situate on a gulf 106 miles in circuit, and
38 across. The towns are, Tænarum<a id="FNanchor_2214" href="#Footnote_2214" class="fnanchor">2214</a>, Amyclæ<a id="FNanchor_2215" href="#Footnote_2215" class="fnanchor">2215</a>, Pheræ<a id="FNanchor_2216" href="#Footnote_2216" class="fnanchor">2216</a>,
and Leuctra<a id="FNanchor_2217" href="#Footnote_2217" class="fnanchor">2217</a>; and, in the interior, Sparta<a id="FNanchor_2218" href="#Footnote_2218" class="fnanchor">2218</a>, Theramne<a id="FNanchor_2219" href="#Footnote_2219" class="fnanchor">2219</a>, and
the spots where Cardamyle<a id="FNanchor_2220" href="#Footnote_2220" class="fnanchor">2220</a>, Pitane<a id="FNanchor_2221" href="#Footnote_2221" class="fnanchor">2221</a>, and Anthea formerly
stood; the former site of Thyrea<a id="FNanchor_2222" href="#Footnote_2222" class="fnanchor">2222</a>, and Gerania<a id="FNanchor_2223" href="#Footnote_2223" class="fnanchor">2223</a>. Here is
also Mount Taygetus<a id="FNanchor_2224" href="#Footnote_2224" class="fnanchor">2224</a>, the river Eurotas, the Gulf of Ægilodes<a id="FNanchor_2225" href="#Footnote_2225" class="fnanchor">2225</a>,
the town of Psamathus, the Gulf of Gytheum<a id="FNanchor_2226" href="#Footnote_2226" class="fnanchor">2226</a>, so
called from the town of that name, from which place the
passage is the safest across to the island of Crete. All these
places are bounded by the Promontory of Malea<a id="FNanchor_2227" href="#Footnote_2227" class="fnanchor">2227</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_9">CHAP. 9.—ARGOLIS.</h3></div>

<p>The next gulf, which extends as far as Scyllæum<a id="FNanchor_2228" href="#Footnote_2228" class="fnanchor">2228</a>, is called
the Argolic Gulf, being fifty miles across, and 162 in circuit.
The towns upon it are, Bœa<a id="FNanchor_2229" href="#Footnote_2229" class="fnanchor">2229</a>, Epidaurus<a id="FNanchor_2230" href="#Footnote_2230" class="fnanchor">2230</a>, surnamed Limera,
Zarax<a id="FNanchor_2231" href="#Footnote_2231" class="fnanchor">2231</a>, and the port of Cyphanta<a id="FNanchor_2232" href="#Footnote_2232" class="fnanchor">2232</a>. The rivers are the
Inachus<a id="FNanchor_2233" href="#Footnote_2233" class="fnanchor">2233</a> and the Erasinus, between which lies Argos, surnamed
Hippium<a id="FNanchor_2234" href="#Footnote_2234" class="fnanchor">2234</a>, situate beyond the place called Lerna<a id="FNanchor_2235" href="#Footnote_2235" class="fnanchor">2235</a>, and
at a distance of two miles from the sea. Nine miles farther is
Mycenæ<a id="FNanchor_2236" href="#Footnote_2236" class="fnanchor">2236</a>, and the place where, it is said, Tiryns<a id="FNanchor_2237" href="#Footnote_2237" class="fnanchor">2237</a> stood; the
site, too, of Mantinea<a id="FNanchor_2238" href="#Footnote_2238" class="fnanchor">2238</a>. The mountains are, Artemius, Apesantus<a id="FNanchor_2239" href="#Footnote_2239" class="fnanchor">2239</a>,
Asterion<a id="FNanchor_2240" href="#Footnote_2240" class="fnanchor">2240</a>, Parparus, and some others, eleven in
number. The fountains are those of Niobe<a id="FNanchor_2241" href="#Footnote_2241" class="fnanchor">2241</a>, Amymone, and
Psamathe.</p>

<p>From Scyllæum to the Isthmus of Corinth is a distance
of 177 miles. We find here the towns of Hermione<a id="FNanchor_2242" href="#Footnote_2242" class="fnanchor">2242</a>,
Trœzen<a id="FNanchor_2243" href="#Footnote_2243" class="fnanchor">2243</a>, Coryphasium<a id="FNanchor_2244" href="#Footnote_2244" class="fnanchor">2244</a>, and Argos, sometimes called “Inachian,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
sometimes “Dipsian”<a id="FNanchor_2245" href="#Footnote_2245" class="fnanchor">2245</a> Argos. Then comes the port
of Schœnites<a id="FNanchor_2246" href="#Footnote_2246" class="fnanchor">2246</a>, and the Saronic Gulf, which was formerly
encircled with a grove of oaks<a id="FNanchor_2247" href="#Footnote_2247" class="fnanchor">2247</a>, from which it derives its
present name, oaks in ancient Greece having been so called.
Upon this gulf is the town of Epidaurus, famous for its
temple of Æsculapius<a id="FNanchor_2248" href="#Footnote_2248" class="fnanchor">2248</a>, the Promontory of Spiræum<a id="FNanchor_2249" href="#Footnote_2249" class="fnanchor">2249</a>, the port
of Anthedus<a id="FNanchor_2250" href="#Footnote_2250" class="fnanchor">2250</a>, Bucephalus<a id="FNanchor_2251" href="#Footnote_2251" class="fnanchor">2251</a>, and then Cenchreæ, previously
mentioned, on this side of the Isthmus, with its temple of
Neptune<a id="FNanchor_2252" href="#Footnote_2252" class="fnanchor">2252</a>, famous for the games celebrated there every five
years. So many are the gulfs which penetrate the shores of
the Peloponnesus, so many the seas which howl around it.
Invaded by the Ionian on the north, it is beaten by the
Sicilian on the west, buffeted by the Cretan on the south,
by the Ægean on the S.E., and by the Myrtoan on the N.E.;
which last sea begins at the Gulf of Megara, and washes all
the coast of Attica.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_10">CHAP. 10. (6.)—ARCADIA.</h3></div>

<p>Its interior is occupied for the greater part by Arcadia,
which, remote from the sea on every side, was originally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
called Drymodes<a id="FNanchor_2253" href="#Footnote_2253" class="fnanchor">2253</a>, and at a later period Pelasgis.
The cities of Arcadia are, Psophis<a id="FNanchor_2254" href="#Footnote_2254" class="fnanchor">2254</a>, Mantinea<a id="FNanchor_2255" href="#Footnote_2255" class="fnanchor">2255</a>, Stymphalus<a id="FNanchor_2256" href="#Footnote_2256" class="fnanchor">2256</a>,

(from which the Palatium<a id="FNanchor_2262" href="#Footnote_2262" class="fnanchor">2262</a> at Rome derives its
name), Megalopolis<a id="FNanchor_2263" href="#Footnote_2263" class="fnanchor">2263</a>, Gortyna<a id="FNanchor_2264" href="#Footnote_2264" class="fnanchor">2264</a>, Bucolium, Carnion, Parrhasia<a id="FNanchor_2265" href="#Footnote_2265" class="fnanchor">2265</a>,

the district of Nemea, commonly known as Bembinadia<a id="FNanchor_2276" href="#Footnote_2276" class="fnanchor">2276</a>.</p>

<p>The mountains of Arcadia are, Pholoë<a id="FNanchor_2277" href="#Footnote_2277" class="fnanchor">2277</a>, with a town of the
same name, Cyllene<a id="FNanchor_2278" href="#Footnote_2278" class="fnanchor">2278</a>, Lycæus<a id="FNanchor_2279" href="#Footnote_2279" class="fnanchor">2279</a>, upon which is the temple of
Lycæan Jupiter; Mænalus<a id="FNanchor_2280" href="#Footnote_2280" class="fnanchor">2280</a>, Artemisius<a id="FNanchor_2281" href="#Footnote_2281" class="fnanchor">2281</a>, Parthenius<a id="FNanchor_2282" href="#Footnote_2282" class="fnanchor">2282</a>, Lampeus<a id="FNanchor_2283" href="#Footnote_2283" class="fnanchor">2283</a>,
and Nonacris<a id="FNanchor_2284" href="#Footnote_2284" class="fnanchor">2284</a>, besides eight others of no note.
The rivers are the Ladon<a id="FNanchor_2285" href="#Footnote_2285" class="fnanchor">2285</a>, which rises in the marshes of
Pheneus<a id="FNanchor_2286" href="#Footnote_2286" class="fnanchor">2286</a>, and the Erymanthus<a id="FNanchor_2287" href="#Footnote_2287" class="fnanchor">2287</a>, which springs from a
mountain of the same name, and flows into the Alpheus.</p>

<p>The other cities of Achaia worthy of mention are those
of the Aliphiræi<a id="FNanchor_2288" href="#Footnote_2288" class="fnanchor">2288</a>, the Abeatæ<a id="FNanchor_2289" href="#Footnote_2289" class="fnanchor">2289</a>, the Pyrgenses<a id="FNanchor_2290" href="#Footnote_2290" class="fnanchor">2290</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>

granted liberty to the whole of Achaia<a id="FNanchor_2295" href="#Footnote_2295" class="fnanchor">2295</a>. The Peloponnesus,
from the Promontory of Malea to the town of Ægium<a id="FNanchor_2296" href="#Footnote_2296" class="fnanchor">2296</a> on
the Corinthian Gulf, is 190 miles in length, and 125 miles
across from Elis to Epidaurus; the distance being, from
Olympia to Argos, through Arcadia, sixty-eight miles. The
distance from Olympia to Phlius has been already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2297" href="#Footnote_2297" class="fnanchor">2297</a>.
Throughout the whole of this region, as though
nature had been desirous to compensate for the inroads of
the sea, seventy-six mountains raise their lofty heads.</p>

<div class="section"><h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_11">CHAP. 11. (7.)—ATTICA.</h3></div>

<p>At the narrow neck of the Isthmus, Hellas begins, by our
people known as Græcia. The first state that presents
itself is Attica, anciently called Acte<a id="FNanchor_2298" href="#Footnote_2298" class="fnanchor">2298</a>. It touches the
Isthmus in that part of it which is called Megaris, from the
colony of Megara<a id="FNanchor_2299" href="#Footnote_2299" class="fnanchor">2299</a>, lying on the opposite side to Pagæ<a id="FNanchor_2300" href="#Footnote_2300" class="fnanchor">2300</a>.</p>

<p>These two towns are situate at the spot where the Peloponnesus
projects to the greatest distance; being placed, one
on each side, upon the very shoulders of Hellas as it were.
The Pagæans, as well as the people of Ægosthena<a id="FNanchor_2301" href="#Footnote_2301" class="fnanchor">2301</a>, belong
to the jurisdiction of Megara. On the coast there is the
port of Schœnos<a id="FNanchor_2302" href="#Footnote_2302" class="fnanchor">2302</a>, the towns of Sidus<a id="FNanchor_2303" href="#Footnote_2303" class="fnanchor">2303</a> and Cremmyon<a id="FNanchor_2304" href="#Footnote_2304" class="fnanchor">2304</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
Scironian Rocks<a id="FNanchor_2305" href="#Footnote_2305" class="fnanchor">2305</a>, six miles in length, Geranea, Megara, and
Eleusis<a id="FNanchor_2306" href="#Footnote_2306" class="fnanchor">2306</a>. Œnoë<a id="FNanchor_2307" href="#Footnote_2307" class="fnanchor">2307</a> and Probalinthos also formerly existed
here; the ports of Piræus and Phalerum<a id="FNanchor_2308" href="#Footnote_2308" class="fnanchor">2308</a> are distant from the
Isthmus fifty-five miles, being united to Athens, which lies
in the interior, by a wall<a id="FNanchor_2309" href="#Footnote_2309" class="fnanchor">2309</a> five miles in length. Athens is a free
city, and needs<a id="FNanchor_2310" href="#Footnote_2310" class="fnanchor">2310</a> not a word more from us in its commendation;
of fame it enjoys even more than enough. In
Attica there are the Fountains of Cephisia<a id="FNanchor_2311" href="#Footnote_2311" class="fnanchor">2311</a>, Larine,
Callirrhoë Enneacrunos<a id="FNanchor_2312" href="#Footnote_2312" class="fnanchor">2312</a>, and the mountains of Brilessus<a id="FNanchor_2313" href="#Footnote_2313" class="fnanchor">2313</a>,
Ægialeus, Icarius, Hymettus<a id="FNanchor_2314" href="#Footnote_2314" class="fnanchor">2314</a>, Lycabettus<a id="FNanchor_2315" href="#Footnote_2315" class="fnanchor">2315</a>, and
the place where Ilissus<a id="FNanchor_2316" href="#Footnote_2316" class="fnanchor">2316</a> stood. At the distance of forty-five
miles from the Piræus is the Promontory of Sunium<a id="FNanchor_2317" href="#Footnote_2317" class="fnanchor">2317</a>.
There is also the Promontory of Thoricos<a id="FNanchor_2318" href="#Footnote_2318" class="fnanchor">2318</a>; Potamos<a id="FNanchor_2319" href="#Footnote_2319" class="fnanchor">2319</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
Steria<a id="FNanchor_2320" href="#Footnote_2320" class="fnanchor">2320</a>, and Brauron<a id="FNanchor_2321" href="#Footnote_2321" class="fnanchor">2321</a>, once towns, the borough of Rhamnus<a id="FNanchor_2322" href="#Footnote_2322" class="fnanchor">2322</a>,
the place where Marathon<a id="FNanchor_2323" href="#Footnote_2323" class="fnanchor">2323</a> stood, the Thriasian<a id="FNanchor_2324" href="#Footnote_2324" class="fnanchor">2324</a> plain,
the town of Melite<a id="FNanchor_2325" href="#Footnote_2325" class="fnanchor">2325</a>, and Oropus<a id="FNanchor_2326" href="#Footnote_2326" class="fnanchor">2326</a> upon the confines of
Bœotia.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_12">CHAP. 12.—BŒOTIA.</h3></div>

<p>In this country are Anthedon<a id="FNanchor_2327" href="#Footnote_2327" class="fnanchor">2327</a>, Onchestus<a id="FNanchor_2328" href="#Footnote_2328" class="fnanchor">2328</a>, the free town
of Thespiæ<a id="FNanchor_2329" href="#Footnote_2329" class="fnanchor">2329</a>, Lebadea<a id="FNanchor_2330" href="#Footnote_2330" class="fnanchor">2330</a>, and then Thebes<a id="FNanchor_2331" href="#Footnote_2331" class="fnanchor">2331</a>, surnamed
Bœotian<a id="FNanchor_2332" href="#Footnote_2332" class="fnanchor">2332</a>, which does not yield the palm to Athens even in
celebrity; the native land, according to the common notion,
of the two Divinities Liber and Hercules. The birth-place
of the Muses too is pointed out in the grove of Helicon.
To this same Thebes also belong the forest of Cithæron<a id="FNanchor_2333" href="#Footnote_2333" class="fnanchor">2333</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
and the river Ismenus. Besides these, there are in Bœotia
the Fountains of Œdipodia, Psamathe, Dirce, Epicrane,
Arethusa, Hippocrene<a id="FNanchor_2334" href="#Footnote_2334" class="fnanchor">2334</a>, Aganippe, and Gargaphie; and, besides
the mountains already mentioned, Mycalesos, Hadylius,

by the opposite island of Eubœa, Aulis<a id="FNanchor_2355" href="#Footnote_2355" class="fnanchor">2355</a>, so famous for its
capacious harbour. The Bœotians formerly had the name

<p>After them come the Locrians, surnamed Epicnemidii<a id="FNanchor_2356" href="#Footnote_2356" class="fnanchor">2356</a>,
formerly called Leleges, through whose country the river
Cephisus passes, in its course to the sea. Their towns are

Cynos. Daphnus<a id="FNanchor_2359" href="#Footnote_2359" class="fnanchor">2359</a> is the only town of Phocis situate on the

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_14">CHAP. 14.—PHTHIOTIS.</h3></div>

<p>Hæmonia follows, a country which has often changed its
name, having been successively called Pelasgic Argos, Hellas,
Thessaly, and Dryopis, always taking its surname from
its kings. In this country was born the king whose name
was Græcus; and from whom Græcia was so called; and here
too was born Hellen<a id="FNanchor_2374" href="#Footnote_2374" class="fnanchor">2374</a>, from whom the Hellenes derive their
name. The same people Homer has called by three different
names, Myrmidones, Hellenes, and Achæi.</p>

<p>That portion of these people which inhabit the country
adjacent to Doris are called Phthiotæ. Their towns are
Echinus<a id="FNanchor_2375" href="#Footnote_2375" class="fnanchor">2375</a>, at the mouth of the river Sperchius, and, at four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
miles from the narrow pass of Thermopylæ<a id="FNanchor_2376" href="#Footnote_2376" class="fnanchor">2376</a>, Heraclea, which
from it takes its surname of Trachin<a id="FNanchor_2377" href="#Footnote_2377" class="fnanchor">2377</a>. Here too is Mount
Callidromus<a id="FNanchor_2378" href="#Footnote_2378" class="fnanchor">2378</a>, and the celebrated towns of Hellas<a id="FNanchor_2379" href="#Footnote_2379" class="fnanchor">2379</a>, Halos<a id="FNanchor_2380" href="#Footnote_2380" class="fnanchor">2380</a>,

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_15">CHAP. 15. (8.)—THESSALY PROPER.</h3></div>

<p>In Thessaly is Orchomenus, formerly called the Minyan<a id="FNanchor_2384" href="#Footnote_2384" class="fnanchor">2384</a>,
and the towns of Almon, by some called Salmon, Atrax<a id="FNanchor_2385" href="#Footnote_2385" class="fnanchor">2385</a>,
and Pelinna; the Fountain of Hyperia; the towns also of
Pheræ<a id="FNanchor_2386" href="#Footnote_2386" class="fnanchor">2386</a>, at the back of which is Pieria<a id="FNanchor_2387" href="#Footnote_2387" class="fnanchor">2387</a>, extending to Macedonia,
Larisa<a id="FNanchor_2388" href="#Footnote_2388" class="fnanchor">2388</a>, Gomphi<a id="FNanchor_2389" href="#Footnote_2389" class="fnanchor">2389</a>, Thebes<a id="FNanchor_2390" href="#Footnote_2390" class="fnanchor">2390</a> of Thessaly, the grove
of Pteleon, the Gulf of Pagasa, the town of Pagasa<a id="FNanchor_2391" href="#Footnote_2391" class="fnanchor">2391</a>, which
was afterwards called Demetrias<a id="FNanchor_2392" href="#Footnote_2392" class="fnanchor">2392</a>, the Plains of Pharsalia,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
with a free city of similar name<a id="FNanchor_2393" href="#Footnote_2393" class="fnanchor">2393</a>, Crannon<a id="FNanchor_2394" href="#Footnote_2394" class="fnanchor">2394</a>, and Iletia.
The mountains of Phthiotis are Nymphæus, once so beautiful
for its garden scenery, the work of nature; Busygæus,
Donacesa, Bermius<a id="FNanchor_2395" href="#Footnote_2395" class="fnanchor">2395</a>, Daphusa, Chimerion, Athamas, and
Stephane. In Thessaly there are thirty-four, of which the
most famous are Cercetii, Olympus<a id="FNanchor_2396" href="#Footnote_2396" class="fnanchor">2396</a>, Pierus, and Ossa, opposite
to which last are Pindus and Othrys, the abodes of the
Lapithæ. These mountains look towards the west, Pelion<a id="FNanchor_2397" href="#Footnote_2397" class="fnanchor">2397</a>
towards the east, all of them forming a curve like an amphitheatre,
in the interior of which, lying before them, are no
less than seventy-five cities. The rivers of Thessaly are the
Apidanus<a id="FNanchor_2398" href="#Footnote_2398" class="fnanchor">2398</a>, the Phœnix<a id="FNanchor_2399" href="#Footnote_2399" class="fnanchor">2399</a>, the Enipeus<a id="FNanchor_2400" href="#Footnote_2400" class="fnanchor">2400</a>, the Onochonus<a id="FNanchor_2401" href="#Footnote_2401" class="fnanchor">2401</a>, and
the Pamisus. There is also the Fountain of Messeis, and
the lake Bœbeis<a id="FNanchor_2402" href="#Footnote_2402" class="fnanchor">2402</a>. The river Peneus<a id="FNanchor_2403" href="#Footnote_2403" class="fnanchor">2403</a> too, superior to all
others in celebrity, takes its rise near Gomphi, and flows
down a well-wooded valley between Ossa and Olympus, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
distance of five hundred stadia, being navigable half that
distance. The vale, for a distance of five miles through which
this river runs, is called by the name of Tempe; being a
jugerum<a id="FNanchor_2404" href="#Footnote_2404" class="fnanchor">2404</a> and a half nearly in breadth, while on the right
and left, the mountain chain slopes away with a gentle
elevation, beyond the range of human vision, the foliage
imparting its colour to the light within. Along this vale
glides the Peneus, reflecting the green tints as it rolls along
its pebbly bed, its banks covered with tufts of verdant
herbage, and enlivened by the melodious warblings of the
birds. The Peneus receives the river Orcus, or rather, I
should say, does not receive it, but merely carries its waters,
which swim on its surface like oil, as Homer says<a id="FNanchor_2405" href="#Footnote_2405" class="fnanchor">2405</a>; and then,
after a short time, rejects them, refusing to allow the waters
of a river devoted to penal sufferings and engendered for
the Furies to mingle with his silvery streams.</p>

world; it was formerly known by the name of Emathia<a id="FNanchor_2427" href="#Footnote_2427" class="fnanchor">2427</a>.
Stretching away towards the nations of Epirus on the west
it lies at the back of Magnesia and Thessaly, being itself
exposed to the attacks of the Dardani<a id="FNanchor_2428" href="#Footnote_2428" class="fnanchor">2428</a>. Pæonia and Pelagonia
protect its northern parts from the Triballi<a id="FNanchor_2429" href="#Footnote_2429" class="fnanchor">2429</a>. Its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>

distance from the sea, Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_2492" href="#Footnote_2492" class="fnanchor">2492</a> and Arethusa. Again, upon
the coast we have Posidium<a id="FNanchor_2493" href="#Footnote_2493" class="fnanchor">2493</a>, and the bay with the town of
Cermorus, Amphipolis<a id="FNanchor_2494" href="#Footnote_2494" class="fnanchor">2494</a>, a free town, and the nation of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
<a id="bisaltae">Bisaltæ</a>. We then come to the river Strymon<a id="FNanchor_2495" href="#Footnote_2495" class="fnanchor">2495</a> which takes
its rise in Mount Hæmus<a id="FNanchor_2496" href="#Footnote_2496" class="fnanchor">2496</a> and forms the boundary of Macedonia:
it is worthy of remark that it first discharges itself
into seven lakes before it proceeds onward in its course.</p>

<p>Such is Macedonia, which was once the mistress of the
world, which once extended<a id="FNanchor_2497" href="#Footnote_2497" class="fnanchor">2497</a> her career over Asia, Armenia,
Iberia, Albania, Cappadocia, Syria, Egypt, Taurus, and Caucasus,
which reduced the whole of the East under her power,
and triumphed over the Bactri, the Medes, and the Persians.
She too it was who proved the conqueror of India, thus
treading in the footsteps of Father Liber<a id="FNanchor_2498" href="#Footnote_2498" class="fnanchor">2498</a> and of Hercules;
and this is that same Macedonia, of which our own general
Paulus Æmilius sold to pillage seventy-two<a id="FNanchor_2499" href="#Footnote_2499" class="fnanchor">2499</a> cities in one day.
So great the difference in her lot resulting from the actions
of two<a id="FNanchor_2500" href="#Footnote_2500" class="fnanchor">2500</a> individuals!</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_18">CHAP. 18. (11.)—THRACE; THE ÆGEAN SEA.</h3></div>

<p>Thrace now follows, divided into fifty strategies<a id="FNanchor_2501" href="#Footnote_2501" class="fnanchor">2501</a>, and to
be reckoned among the most powerful nations of Europe.
Among its peoples whom we ought not to omit to name are
the Denseletæ and the Medi, dwelling upon the right bank
of the Strymon, and joining up to the Bisaltæ above<a id="FNanchor_2502" href="#Footnote_2502" class="fnanchor">2502</a> mentioned;
on the left there are the Digerri and a number of
tribes of the Bessi<a id="FNanchor_2503" href="#Footnote_2503" class="fnanchor">2503</a>, with various names, as far as the river
Mestus<a id="FNanchor_2504" href="#Footnote_2504" class="fnanchor">2504</a>, which winds around the foot of Mount<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Pangæum<a id="FNanchor_2505" href="#Footnote_2505" class="fnanchor">2505</a>, passing among the Elethi, the Diobessi<a id="FNanchor_2506" href="#Footnote_2506" class="fnanchor">2506</a>, the Carbilesi;
and then the Brysæ, the Sapæi, and the Odomanti.
The territory of the Odrysæ<a id="FNanchor_2507" href="#Footnote_2507" class="fnanchor">2507</a> gives birth to the Hebrus<a id="FNanchor_2508" href="#Footnote_2508" class="fnanchor">2508</a>, its
banks being inhabited by the Cabyleti, the Pyrogeri, the
Drugeri, the Cænici, the Hypsalti, the Beni, the Corpili,
the Bottiæi, and the Edoni<a id="FNanchor_2509" href="#Footnote_2509" class="fnanchor">2509</a>. In the same district are also the
Selletæ, the Priantæ, the Doloncæ, the Thyni, and the
Greater Cœletæ, below Mount Hæmus, the Lesser at the
foot of Rhodope. Between these tribes runs the river Hebrus.
We then come to a town at the foot of Rhodope,
first called Poneropolis<a id="FNanchor_2510" href="#Footnote_2510" class="fnanchor">2510</a>, afterwards Philippopolis<a id="FNanchor_2511" href="#Footnote_2511" class="fnanchor">2511</a> from the
name of its founder, and now, from the peculiarity of its
situation, Trimontium<a id="FNanchor_2512" href="#Footnote_2512" class="fnanchor">2512</a>. To reach the summit of Hæmus
you have to travel six<a id="FNanchor_2513" href="#Footnote_2513" class="fnanchor">2513</a> miles. The sides of it that look in
the opposite direction and slope towards the Ister are inhabited
by the Mœsi<a id="FNanchor_2514" href="#Footnote_2514" class="fnanchor">2514</a>, the Getæ, the Aorsi, the Gaudæ, and
the Clariæ; below them, are the Arræi Sarmatæ<a id="FNanchor_2515" href="#Footnote_2515" class="fnanchor">2515</a>, also called
Arreatæ, the Scythians, and, about the shores of the Euxine,
the Moriseni and the Sithonii, the forefathers of the poet
Orpheus<a id="FNanchor_2516" href="#Footnote_2516" class="fnanchor">2516</a>, dwell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span></p>

<p>Thus is Thrace bounded by the Ister on the north, by the
Euxine, and the Propontis<a id="FNanchor_2517" href="#Footnote_2517" class="fnanchor">2517</a> on the east, and by the Ægean
Sea on the south; on the coast of which, after leaving the
Strymon, we come in turn to Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_2518" href="#Footnote_2518" class="fnanchor">2518</a>, Œsyma<a id="FNanchor_2519" href="#Footnote_2519" class="fnanchor">2519</a>, Neapolis<a id="FNanchor_2520" href="#Footnote_2520" class="fnanchor">2520</a>
and Datos. In the interior is the colony of Philippi<a id="FNanchor_2521" href="#Footnote_2521" class="fnanchor">2521</a>,
distant from Dyrrhachium 325 miles; also Scotussa<a id="FNanchor_2522" href="#Footnote_2522" class="fnanchor">2522</a>, the
city of Topiris, the mouth of the river Mestus<a id="FNanchor_2523" href="#Footnote_2523" class="fnanchor">2523</a>, Mount
Pangæus, Heraclea<a id="FNanchor_2524" href="#Footnote_2524" class="fnanchor">2524</a>, Olynthos<a id="FNanchor_2525" href="#Footnote_2525" class="fnanchor">2525</a>, Abdera<a id="FNanchor_2526" href="#Footnote_2526" class="fnanchor">2526</a>, a free city, the
people of the Bistones<a id="FNanchor_2527" href="#Footnote_2527" class="fnanchor">2527</a> and their Lake. Here was formerly
the city of Tirida, which struck such terror with its stables
of the horses<a id="FNanchor_2528" href="#Footnote_2528" class="fnanchor">2528</a> of Diomedes. At the present day we find
here Dicæa<a id="FNanchor_2529" href="#Footnote_2529" class="fnanchor">2529</a>, Ismaron<a id="FNanchor_2530" href="#Footnote_2530" class="fnanchor">2530</a>, the place where Parthenion stood,
Phalesina, and Maronea<a id="FNanchor_2531" href="#Footnote_2531" class="fnanchor">2531</a>, formerly called Orthagorea. We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
then come to Mount Serrium<a id="FNanchor_2532" href="#Footnote_2532" class="fnanchor">2532</a> and Zone<a id="FNanchor_2533" href="#Footnote_2533" class="fnanchor">2533</a>, and then the
place called Doriscus<a id="FNanchor_2534" href="#Footnote_2534" class="fnanchor">2534</a>, capable of containing ten thousand
men, for it was in bodies of ten thousand that Xerxes here
numbered his army. We then come to the mouth of the
Hebrus<a id="FNanchor_2535" href="#Footnote_2535" class="fnanchor">2535</a>, the Port of Stentor, and the free town of Ænos<a id="FNanchor_2536" href="#Footnote_2536" class="fnanchor">2536</a>,
with the tomb there of Polydorus<a id="FNanchor_2537" href="#Footnote_2537" class="fnanchor">2537</a>, the region formerly of
the Cicones.</p>

<p>From Doriscus there is a winding coast as far as Macron
Tichos<a id="FNanchor_2538" href="#Footnote_2538" class="fnanchor">2538</a>, or the “Long Wall,” a distance of 122 miles;
round Doriscus flows the river Melas, from which the Gulf
of Melas<a id="FNanchor_2539" href="#Footnote_2539" class="fnanchor">2539</a> receives its name. The towns are, Cypsela<a id="FNanchor_2540" href="#Footnote_2540" class="fnanchor">2540</a>,
Bisanthe<a id="FNanchor_2541" href="#Footnote_2541" class="fnanchor">2541</a>, and Macron Tichos, already mentioned, so called
because a wall extends from that spot between the two
seas,—that is to say, from the Propontis to the Gulf of
Melas, thus excluding the Chersonesus<a id="FNanchor_2542" href="#Footnote_2542" class="fnanchor">2542</a>, which projects
beyond it.</p>

<p>The other side of Thrace now begins, on the coast<a id="FNanchor_2543" href="#Footnote_2543" class="fnanchor">2543</a>
of the Euxine, where the river Ister discharges itself; and
it is in this quarter perhaps that Thrace possesses the finest
cities, Histropolis<a id="FNanchor_2544" href="#Footnote_2544" class="fnanchor">2544</a>, namely, founded by the Milesians,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
Tomi<a id="FNanchor_2545" href="#Footnote_2545" class="fnanchor">2545</a>, and Callatis<a id="FNanchor_2546" href="#Footnote_2546" class="fnanchor">2546</a>, formerly called Acervetis. It also
had the cities of Heraclea and Bizone, which latter was
swallowed up by an earthquake; it now has Dionysopolis<a id="FNanchor_2547" href="#Footnote_2547" class="fnanchor">2547</a>,
formerly called Cruni, which is washed by the river Zyras.
All this country was formerly possessed by the Scythians,
surnamed Aroteres; their towns were, Aphrodisias, Libistos,
Zygere, Rocobe, Eumenia, Parthenopolis, and Gerania<a id="FNanchor_2548" href="#Footnote_2548" class="fnanchor">2548</a>,
where a nation of Pigmies is said to have dwelt; the barbarians
used to call them Cattuzi, and entertain a belief
that they were put to flight by cranes. Upon the coast,
proceeding from Dionysopolis, is Odessus<a id="FNanchor_2549" href="#Footnote_2549" class="fnanchor">2549</a>, a city of the
Milesians, the river Panysus<a id="FNanchor_2550" href="#Footnote_2550" class="fnanchor">2550</a>, and the town of Tetranaulochus.
Mount Hæmus, which, with its vast chain, overhangs
the Euxine, had in former times upon its summit
the town of Aristæum<a id="FNanchor_2551" href="#Footnote_2551" class="fnanchor">2551</a>. At the present day there are upon
the coast Mesembria<a id="FNanchor_2552" href="#Footnote_2552" class="fnanchor">2552</a>, and Anchialum<a id="FNanchor_2553" href="#Footnote_2553" class="fnanchor">2553</a>, where Messa formerly
stood. The region of Astice formerly had a town
called Anthium; at the present day Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_2554" href="#Footnote_2554" class="fnanchor">2554</a> occupies
its site. The rivers here are the Panisos, the Riras, the
Tearus, and the Orosines; there are also the towns of Thynias<a id="FNanchor_2555" href="#Footnote_2555" class="fnanchor">2555</a>,
Halmydessos<a id="FNanchor_2556" href="#Footnote_2556" class="fnanchor">2556</a>, Develton<a id="FNanchor_2557" href="#Footnote_2557" class="fnanchor">2557</a>, with its lake, now known
as Deultum, a colony of veterans, and Phinopolis, near
which last is the Bosporus<a id="FNanchor_2558" href="#Footnote_2558" class="fnanchor">2558</a>. From the mouth of the Ister
to the entrance of the Euxine, some writers have made to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
a distance of 555 miles; Agrippa, however, increases the
length by sixty miles. The distance thence to Macron Tichos,
or the Long Wall, previously mentioned, is 150 miles; and,
from it to the extremity of the Chersonesus, 126.</p>

<p>On leaving the Bosporus we come to the Gulf of Casthenes<a id="FNanchor_2559" href="#Footnote_2559" class="fnanchor">2559</a>,
and two harbours, the one called the Old Men’s
Haven, and the other the Women’s Haven. Next comes
the promontory of Chrysoceras<a id="FNanchor_2560" href="#Footnote_2560" class="fnanchor">2560</a>, upon which is the town of
Byzantium<a id="FNanchor_2561" href="#Footnote_2561" class="fnanchor">2561</a>, a free state, formerly called Lygos, distant from
Dyrrhachium 711 miles,—so great being the space of land
that intervenes between the Adriatic Sea and the Propontis.
We next come to the rivers Bathynias and Pydaras<a id="FNanchor_2562" href="#Footnote_2562" class="fnanchor">2562</a>, or
Athyras, and the towns of Selymbria<a id="FNanchor_2563" href="#Footnote_2563" class="fnanchor">2563</a> and Perinthus<a id="FNanchor_2564" href="#Footnote_2564" class="fnanchor">2564</a>, which
join the mainland by a neck only 200 feet in width. In the
interior are Bizya<a id="FNanchor_2565" href="#Footnote_2565" class="fnanchor">2565</a>, a citadel of the kings of Thrace, and hated
by the swallows, in consequence of the sacrilegious crime
of Tereus<a id="FNanchor_2566" href="#Footnote_2566" class="fnanchor">2566</a>; the district called Cænica<a id="FNanchor_2567" href="#Footnote_2567" class="fnanchor">2567</a>, and the colony of
Flaviopolis, where formerly stood a town called Cæla. Then,
at a distance of fifty miles from Bizya, we come to the colony
of Apros, distant from Philippi 180 miles. Upon the coast
is the river Erginus<a id="FNanchor_2568" href="#Footnote_2568" class="fnanchor">2568</a>; here formerly stood the town of
Ganos<a id="FNanchor_2569" href="#Footnote_2569" class="fnanchor">2569</a>; and Lysimachia<a id="FNanchor_2570" href="#Footnote_2570" class="fnanchor">2570</a> in the Chersonesus is being now
gradually deserted.</p>

<p>At this spot there is another isthmus<a id="FNanchor_2571" href="#Footnote_2571" class="fnanchor">2571</a>, similar in name
to the other<a id="FNanchor_2572" href="#Footnote_2572" class="fnanchor">2572</a>, and of about equal width; and, in a manner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
by no means dissimilar, two cities formerly stood on the shore,
one on either side, Pactye on the side of the Propontis, and
Cardia<a id="FNanchor_2573" href="#Footnote_2573" class="fnanchor">2573</a> on that of the Gulf of Melas, the latter deriving its
name from the shape<a id="FNanchor_2574" href="#Footnote_2574" class="fnanchor">2574</a> which the land assumes. These, however,
were afterwards united with Lysimachia<a id="FNanchor_2575" href="#Footnote_2575" class="fnanchor">2575</a>, which stands
at a distance of five miles from Macron Tichos. The Chersonesus
formerly had, on the side of the Propontis, the towns
of Tiristasis, Crithotes, and Cissa<a id="FNanchor_2576" href="#Footnote_2576" class="fnanchor">2576</a>, on the banks of the river
Ægos<a id="FNanchor_2577" href="#Footnote_2577" class="fnanchor">2577</a>; it now has, at a distance of twenty-two<a id="FNanchor_2578" href="#Footnote_2578" class="fnanchor">2578</a> miles from
the colony of Apros, Resistos, which stands opposite to the
colony of Parium. The Hellespont also, which separates,
as we have already<a id="FNanchor_2579" href="#Footnote_2579" class="fnanchor">2579</a> stated, Europe from Asia, by a channel
seven stadia in width, has four cities facing each other,
Callipolis<a id="FNanchor_2580" href="#Footnote_2580" class="fnanchor">2580</a> and Sestos<a id="FNanchor_2581" href="#Footnote_2581" class="fnanchor">2581</a> in Europe, and Lampsacus<a id="FNanchor_2582" href="#Footnote_2582" class="fnanchor">2582</a> and
Abydos<a id="FNanchor_2583" href="#Footnote_2583" class="fnanchor">2583</a> in Asia. On the Chersonesus, there is the promontory
of Mastusia<a id="FNanchor_2584" href="#Footnote_2584" class="fnanchor">2584</a>, lying opposite to Sigeum<a id="FNanchor_2585" href="#Footnote_2585" class="fnanchor">2585</a>; upon
one side of it stands the Cynossema<a id="FNanchor_2586" href="#Footnote_2586" class="fnanchor">2586</a> (for so the tomb of
Hecuba is called), the naval station<a id="FNanchor_2587" href="#Footnote_2587" class="fnanchor">2587</a> of the Achæans, and a
tower; and near it the shrine<a id="FNanchor_2588" href="#Footnote_2588" class="fnanchor">2588</a> of Protesilaüs. On the extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
front of the Chersonesus, which is called Æolium, there
is the city of Elæus. Advancing thence towards the Gulf of
Melas, we have the port of Cœlos<a id="FNanchor_2589" href="#Footnote_2589" class="fnanchor">2589</a>, Panormus, and then
Cardia, previously mentioned.</p>

<p>In this manner is the third great Gulf of Europe bounded.
The mountains of Thrace, besides those already mentioned,
are Edonus, Gigemoros, Meritus, and Melamphyllos; the
rivers are the Bargus and the Syrmus, which fall into the
Hebrus. The length of Macedonia, Thrace, and the Hellespont
has been already<a id="FNanchor_2590" href="#Footnote_2590" class="fnanchor">2590</a> mentioned; some writers, however,
make it 720 miles, the breadth being 384.</p>

<p>What may be called a rock rather than an island, lying
between Tenos and Chios, has given its name to the Ægean
Sea; it has the name of Æx<a id="FNanchor_2591" href="#Footnote_2591" class="fnanchor">2591</a> from its strong resemblance
to a goat, which is so called in Greek, and shoots precipitately
from out of the middle of the sea. Those who are sailing
towards the isle of Andros from Achaia, see this rock on
the left, boding no good, and warning them of its dangers.
Part of the Ægean Sea bears the name of Myrtoan<a id="FNanchor_2592" href="#Footnote_2592" class="fnanchor">2592</a>, being
so called from the small island [of Myrtos] which is seen
as you sail towards Macedonia from Geræstus, not far from
Carystus<a id="FNanchor_2593" href="#Footnote_2593" class="fnanchor">2593</a> in Eubœa. The Romans include all these seas
under two names,—the Macedonian, in those parts where it
touches the coasts of Macedonia or Thrace, and the Grecian
where it washes the shores of Greece. The Greeks, however,
divide the Ionian Sea into the Sicilian and the Cretan
Seas, after the name of those islands; and they give the
name of Icarian to that part which lies between Samos and
Myconos. The gulfs which we have already mentioned,
have given to these seas the rest of their names. Such,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
then, are the seas and the various nations which are comprehended
in the third great Gulf of Europe.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_19">CHAP. 19. (12.)—THE ISLANDS WHICH LIE BEFORE THE
LANDS ALREADY MENTIONED.</h3></div>

<p>Lying opposite to Thesprotia, at a distance of twelve
miles from Buthrotus, and of fifty from Acroceraunia, is the
island of Corcyra<a id="FNanchor_2594" href="#Footnote_2594" class="fnanchor">2594</a>, with a city of the same name, the citizens
of which are free; also a town called Cassiope<a id="FNanchor_2595" href="#Footnote_2595" class="fnanchor">2595</a>, and a
temple dedicated to Jupiter Cassius. This island is ninety-seven
miles in length, and in Homer has the names of
Scheria and Phæacia; while Callimachus calls it Drepane.
There are some other islands around it, such as Thoronos<a id="FNanchor_2596" href="#Footnote_2596" class="fnanchor">2596</a>,
lying in the direction of Italy, and the two islands of Paxos<a id="FNanchor_2597" href="#Footnote_2597" class="fnanchor">2597</a>
in that of Leucadia, both of them five miles distant from
Corcyra. Not far<a id="FNanchor_2598" href="#Footnote_2598" class="fnanchor">2598</a> from these, and in front of Corcyra, are
Ericusa, Marathe, Elaphusa, Malthace, Trachie, Pythionia,
Ptychia, Tarachie, and, off Phalacrum<a id="FNanchor_2599" href="#Footnote_2599" class="fnanchor">2599</a>, a promontory of
Corcyra, the rock into which (according to the story, which
arises no doubt from the similarity of appearance) the ship
of Ulysses was changed.</p>

<p>Before Leucimna<a id="FNanchor_2600" href="#Footnote_2600" class="fnanchor">2600</a> we find the islands of Sybota, and between
Leucadia and Achaia a great number of islands, among
which are those called Teleboïdes<a id="FNanchor_2601" href="#Footnote_2601" class="fnanchor">2601</a>, as also Taphiæ; by the
natives, those which lie before Leucadia are called by the
names of Taphias, Oxiæ, and Prinoessa<a id="FNanchor_2602" href="#Footnote_2602" class="fnanchor">2602</a>; while those that
are in front of Ætolia are the Echinades<a id="FNanchor_2603" href="#Footnote_2603" class="fnanchor">2603</a>, consisting of
Ægialia, Cotonis, Thyatira, Geoaris, Dionysia, Cyrnus,
Chalcis, Pinara, and Mystus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<p>In front of these, and lying out at sea, are Cephallenia<a id="FNanchor_2604" href="#Footnote_2604" class="fnanchor">2604</a> and
Zacynthus<a id="FNanchor_2605" href="#Footnote_2605" class="fnanchor">2605</a>, both of them free, Ithaca<a id="FNanchor_2606" href="#Footnote_2606" class="fnanchor">2606</a>, Dulichium<a id="FNanchor_2607" href="#Footnote_2607" class="fnanchor">2607</a>, Same<a id="FNanchor_2608" href="#Footnote_2608" class="fnanchor">2608</a>,
and Crocyle<a id="FNanchor_2609" href="#Footnote_2609" class="fnanchor">2609</a>. Cephallenia, formerly known as Melæna<a id="FNanchor_2610" href="#Footnote_2610" class="fnanchor">2610</a>,
lies at a distance of eleven miles from Paxos, and is ninety-three
miles in circumference: its city of Same has been
levelled to the ground by the Romans; but it still possesses
three others<a id="FNanchor_2611" href="#Footnote_2611" class="fnanchor">2611</a>. Between this island and Achaia lies
the island of Zacynthus, remarkable for its city of the
same name, and for its singular fertility. It formerly had
the name of Hyrie, and lies to the south of Cephallenia, at
a distance of twenty-five miles; in it there is the famous
mountain of Elatus<a id="FNanchor_2612" href="#Footnote_2612" class="fnanchor">2612</a>. This island is thirty-six miles in circumference.
At a distance of fifteen miles from Zacynthus
is Ithaca, in which is Mount Neritus<a id="FNanchor_2613" href="#Footnote_2613" class="fnanchor">2613</a>; its circumference
in all is twenty-five miles. Twelve miles distant from
this island is Araxus<a id="FNanchor_2614" href="#Footnote_2614" class="fnanchor">2614</a>, a promontory of the Peloponnesus.
Before Ithaca, lying out in the main sea, are Asteris<a id="FNanchor_2615" href="#Footnote_2615" class="fnanchor">2615</a> and
Prote; and before Zacynthus, at a distance of thirty-five
miles in the direction of the south-east wind, are the
two Strophades<a id="FNanchor_2616" href="#Footnote_2616" class="fnanchor">2616</a>, by some known as the Plotæ. Before
Cephallenia lies Letoia<a id="FNanchor_2617" href="#Footnote_2617" class="fnanchor">2617</a>, before Pylos the three Sphagiæ<a id="FNanchor_2618" href="#Footnote_2618" class="fnanchor">2618</a>,
and before Messene the Œnussæ<a id="FNanchor_2619" href="#Footnote_2619" class="fnanchor">2619</a>, as many in number.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span></p>

<p>In the Asinæan Gulf there are the three Thyrides<a id="FNanchor_2620" href="#Footnote_2620" class="fnanchor">2620</a>, and in
that of Laconia Theganusa<a id="FNanchor_2621" href="#Footnote_2621" class="fnanchor">2621</a>, Cothon, and Cythera<a id="FNanchor_2622" href="#Footnote_2622" class="fnanchor">2622</a>, with the
town of that name, the former name of which island was
Porphyris. It is situate five miles from the promontory of
Malea<a id="FNanchor_2623" href="#Footnote_2623" class="fnanchor">2623</a>, thus forming a strait very dangerous to navigation. In
the Gulf of Argolis are Pityusa<a id="FNanchor_2624" href="#Footnote_2624" class="fnanchor">2624</a>, Irine, and Ephyre; opposite
the territory of Hermione<a id="FNanchor_2625" href="#Footnote_2625" class="fnanchor">2625</a>, Tiparenus, Aperopia<a id="FNanchor_2626" href="#Footnote_2626" class="fnanchor">2626</a>, Colonis<a id="FNanchor_2627" href="#Footnote_2627" class="fnanchor">2627</a>,
and Aristera; and, opposite that of Trœzen, Calauria<a id="FNanchor_2628" href="#Footnote_2628" class="fnanchor">2628</a>, at a
distance of half a mile, Plateis<a id="FNanchor_2629" href="#Footnote_2629" class="fnanchor">2629</a>, Belbina, Lasia, and Baucidias.
Opposite Epidaurus is Cecryphalos<a id="FNanchor_2630" href="#Footnote_2630" class="fnanchor">2630</a>, and Pityonesos<a id="FNanchor_2631" href="#Footnote_2631" class="fnanchor">2631</a>,
six miles distant from the mainland; and, at a
distance of fifteen miles from this last, Ægina<a id="FNanchor_2632" href="#Footnote_2632" class="fnanchor">2632</a>, a free island,
the length of which, as you sail past it, is eighteen miles.
This island is twenty miles distant from Piræus, the port of
Athens: it used formerly to be called Œnone. Opposite
the promontory of Spiræum<a id="FNanchor_2633" href="#Footnote_2633" class="fnanchor">2633</a>, lie Eleusa<a id="FNanchor_2634" href="#Footnote_2634" class="fnanchor">2634</a>, Adendros<a id="FNanchor_2635" href="#Footnote_2635" class="fnanchor">2635</a>, the
two islands called Craugiæ, the two Cæciæ, Selachusa,
Cenchreis, and Aspis; as also, in the Gulf of Megara, the
four Methurides. Ægila<a id="FNanchor_2636" href="#Footnote_2636" class="fnanchor">2636</a> lies at a distance of fifteen miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
from Cythera, and of twenty-five from Phalasarna, a city
of Crete.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_20">CHAP. 20.—CRETE.</h3></div>

<p>Crete itself lies from east to west, the one side facing the
south, the other the north, and is known to fame by the
renown of its hundred cities. Dosiades says, that it took
its name from the nymph Crete, the daughter of Hesperides<a id="FNanchor_2637" href="#Footnote_2637" class="fnanchor">2637</a>;
Anaximander, from a king of the Curetes, Philistides of Mallus
* * * * *; while Crates says that it was at first called Aëria,
and after that Curetis; and some have been of opinion
that it had the name of Macaron<a id="FNanchor_2638" href="#Footnote_2638" class="fnanchor">2638</a> from the serenity of its
climate. In breadth it nowhere exceeds fifty miles, being
widest about the middle. In length, however, it is full 270
miles, and 589 in circumference, forming a bend towards
the Cretan Sea, which takes its name from it. At its
eastern extremity is the Promontory of Sammonium<a id="FNanchor_2639" href="#Footnote_2639" class="fnanchor">2639</a>, facing
Rhodes, while towards the west it throws out that of Criumetopon<a id="FNanchor_2640" href="#Footnote_2640" class="fnanchor">2640</a>,
in the direction of Cyrene.</p>

<p>The more remarkable cities of Crete are, Phalasarna, Etæa<a id="FNanchor_2641" href="#Footnote_2641" class="fnanchor">2641</a>,
Cisamon<a id="FNanchor_2642" href="#Footnote_2642" class="fnanchor">2642</a>, Pergamum, Cydonia<a id="FNanchor_2643" href="#Footnote_2643" class="fnanchor">2643</a>, Minoium<a id="FNanchor_2644" href="#Footnote_2644" class="fnanchor">2644</a>, Apteron<a id="FNanchor_2645" href="#Footnote_2645" class="fnanchor">2645</a>, Pantomatrium,
Amphimalla<a id="FNanchor_2646" href="#Footnote_2646" class="fnanchor">2646</a>, Rhithymna, Panormus, Cytæum, Apollonia,
Matium<a id="FNanchor_2647" href="#Footnote_2647" class="fnanchor">2647</a>, Heraclea, Miletos, Ampelos, Hierapytna<a id="FNanchor_2648" href="#Footnote_2648" class="fnanchor">2648</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
Lebena<a id="FNanchor_2649" href="#Footnote_2649" class="fnanchor">2649</a>, and Hierapolis; and, in the interior, Gortyna<a id="FNanchor_2650" href="#Footnote_2650" class="fnanchor">2650</a>, Phæstum,
Cnossus<a id="FNanchor_2651" href="#Footnote_2651" class="fnanchor">2651</a>, Polyrrenium, Myrina, Lycastus, Rhamnus,
Lyctus, Dium<a id="FNanchor_2652" href="#Footnote_2652" class="fnanchor">2652</a>, Asus, Pyloros, Rhytion, Elatos, Pharæ,
Holopyxos, Lasos, Eleuthernæ<a id="FNanchor_2653" href="#Footnote_2653" class="fnanchor">2653</a>, Therapnæ, Marathusa, and
Tylisos; besides some sixty others, of which the memory
only exists. The mountains are those of Cadistus<a id="FNanchor_2654" href="#Footnote_2654" class="fnanchor">2654</a>,
Ida, Dictynnæus, and Corycus<a id="FNanchor_2655" href="#Footnote_2655" class="fnanchor">2655</a>. This island is distant, at
its promontory of Criumetopon, according to Agrippa, from
Phycus<a id="FNanchor_2656" href="#Footnote_2656" class="fnanchor">2656</a>, the promontory of Cyrene, 125 miles; and at Cadistus,
from Malea in the Peloponnesus, eighty. From the
island of Carpathos<a id="FNanchor_2657" href="#Footnote_2657" class="fnanchor">2657</a>, at its promontory of Sammonium it
lies in a westerly direction, at a distance of sixty miles; this
last-named island is situate between it and Rhodes.</p>

<p>The other islands in its vicinity, and lying in front of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Peloponnesus, are the two isles known as Corycæ, and the
two called Mylæ<a id="FNanchor_2658" href="#Footnote_2658" class="fnanchor">2658</a>. On the north side, having Crete on the
right, and opposite to Cydonia, is Leuce<a id="FNanchor_2659" href="#Footnote_2659" class="fnanchor">2659</a>, and the two islands
known as Budroæ<a id="FNanchor_2660" href="#Footnote_2660" class="fnanchor">2660</a>. Opposite to Matium lies Dia<a id="FNanchor_2661" href="#Footnote_2661" class="fnanchor">2661</a>; opposite
to the promontory of Itanum<a id="FNanchor_2662" href="#Footnote_2662" class="fnanchor">2662</a>, Onisia and Leuce; and over
against Hierapytna, Chrysa and Gaudos<a id="FNanchor_2663" href="#Footnote_2663" class="fnanchor">2663</a>. In the same
neighbourhood, also, are Ophiussa, Butoa, and Aradus; and,
after doubling Criumetopon, we come to the three islands
known as Musagorus. Before the promontory of Sammonium
lie the islands of Phocœ, the Platiæ, the Sirnides,
Naulochos, Armedon, and Zephyre.</p>

<p>Belonging to Hellas, but still in the Ægean Sea, we have
the Lichades<a id="FNanchor_2664" href="#Footnote_2664" class="fnanchor">2664</a>, consisting of Scarphia, Coresa, Phocaria,
and many others which face Attica, but have no towns
upon them, and are consequently of little note. Opposite
Eleusis, however, is the far-famed Salamis<a id="FNanchor_2665" href="#Footnote_2665" class="fnanchor">2665</a>; before it, Psyttalia<a id="FNanchor_2666" href="#Footnote_2666" class="fnanchor">2666</a>;
and, at a distance of five miles from Sunium, the
island of Helene<a id="FNanchor_2667" href="#Footnote_2667" class="fnanchor">2667</a>. At the same distance from this last is
Ceos<a id="FNanchor_2668" href="#Footnote_2668" class="fnanchor">2668</a>, which some of our countrymen have called Cea, and
the Greeks Hydrussa, an island which has been torn away
from Eubœa. It was formerly 500 stadia in length; but
more recently four-fifths of it, in the direction of Bœotia, have
been swallowed up by the sea. The only towns it now has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
left are Iulis and Carthæa<a id="FNanchor_2669" href="#Footnote_2669" class="fnanchor">2669</a>; Coresus<a id="FNanchor_2670" href="#Footnote_2670" class="fnanchor">2670</a> and Pœëessa<a id="FNanchor_2671" href="#Footnote_2671" class="fnanchor">2671</a> have
perished. Varro informs us, that from this place there used to
come a cloth of very fine texture, used for women’s dresses.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_21">CHAP. 21.—EUBŒA.</h3></div>

<p>Eubœa<a id="FNanchor_2672" href="#Footnote_2672" class="fnanchor">2672</a> itself has also been rent away from Bœotia; the
channel of the Euripus, which flows between them, being so
narrow as to admit of the opposite shores being united by
a bridge<a id="FNanchor_2673" href="#Footnote_2673" class="fnanchor">2673</a>. At the south, this island is remarkable for its
two promontories, that of Geræstus<a id="FNanchor_2674" href="#Footnote_2674" class="fnanchor">2674</a>, which looks towards
Attica, and that of Caphareus<a id="FNanchor_2675" href="#Footnote_2675" class="fnanchor">2675</a>, which faces the Hellespont;
on the north it has that of Cenæum<a id="FNanchor_2676" href="#Footnote_2676" class="fnanchor">2676</a>. In no part does
this island extend to a greater breadth than forty miles,
while it never contracts to less than two. In length it
runs along the whole coast of Bœotia, extending from
Attica as far as Thessaly, a distance of 150 miles<a id="FNanchor_2677" href="#Footnote_2677" class="fnanchor">2677</a>. In
circumference it measures 365, and is distant from the
Hellespont, on the side of Caphareus, 225 miles. The cities
for which it was formerly famous were, Pyrrha, Porthmos,
Nesos, Cerinthos<a id="FNanchor_2678" href="#Footnote_2678" class="fnanchor">2678</a>, Oreum, Dium, Ædepsos<a id="FNanchor_2679" href="#Footnote_2679" class="fnanchor">2679</a>, Ocha, and
Œchalia; at present it is ennobled by those of Chalcis<a id="FNanchor_2680" href="#Footnote_2680" class="fnanchor">2680</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
(opposite which, on the mainland, is Aulis), Geræstus<a id="FNanchor_2681" href="#Footnote_2681" class="fnanchor">2681</a>,
Eretria<a id="FNanchor_2682" href="#Footnote_2682" class="fnanchor">2682</a>, Carystus<a id="FNanchor_2683" href="#Footnote_2683" class="fnanchor">2683</a>, Oritanum, and Artemisium<a id="FNanchor_2684" href="#Footnote_2684" class="fnanchor">2684</a>. Here are
also the Fountain of Arethusa<a id="FNanchor_2685" href="#Footnote_2685" class="fnanchor">2685</a>, the river Lelantus, and the
warm springs known as Ellopiæ; it is still better known,
however, for the marble of Carystus. This island used
formerly to be called Chalcodontis and Macris<a id="FNanchor_2686" href="#Footnote_2686" class="fnanchor">2686</a>, as we learn
from Dionysius and Ephorus; according to Aristides, Macra;
also, as Callidemus says, Chalcis, because copper was first
discovered here. Menæchmus says that it was called
Abantias<a id="FNanchor_2687" href="#Footnote_2687" class="fnanchor">2687</a>, and the poets generally give it the name of
Asopis.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_22">CHAP. 22.—THE CYCLADES.</h3></div>

<p>Beyond Eubœa, and out in the Myrtoan<a id="FNanchor_2688" href="#Footnote_2688" class="fnanchor">2688</a> Sea, are numerous
other islands; but those more especially famous are, Glauconnesos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
and the Ægila<a id="FNanchor_2689" href="#Footnote_2689" class="fnanchor">2689</a>. Off the promontory, too, of
Geræstus are the Cyclades, lying in a circle around Delos,
from which circumstance<a id="FNanchor_2690" href="#Footnote_2690" class="fnanchor">2690</a> they derive their name. The
first of them is the one called Andros<a id="FNanchor_2691" href="#Footnote_2691" class="fnanchor">2691</a> with a city of the
same name, distant from Geræstus ten miles, and from Ceos
thirty-nine. Myrsilus tells us that this island was at first
called Cauros, and after that Antandros; Callimachus calls
it Lasia, and others again Nonagria, Hydrussa, and Epagris.
It is ninety-three miles in circumference. At a distance of
one mile from Andros and of fifteen from Delos, is Tenos<a id="FNanchor_2692" href="#Footnote_2692" class="fnanchor">2692</a>,
with a city of the same name; this island is fifteen miles
in length. Aristotle says that it was formerly called Hydrussa,
from the abundance of water found here, while some
writers call it Ophiussa<a id="FNanchor_2693" href="#Footnote_2693" class="fnanchor">2693</a>. The other islands are, Myconos<a id="FNanchor_2694" href="#Footnote_2694" class="fnanchor">2694</a>,
with the mountain of Dimastus<a id="FNanchor_2695" href="#Footnote_2695" class="fnanchor">2695</a>, distant from Delos fifteen<a id="FNanchor_2696" href="#Footnote_2696" class="fnanchor">2696</a>
miles; Siphnus<a id="FNanchor_2697" href="#Footnote_2697" class="fnanchor">2697</a>, formerly called Meropia and Acis, twenty-eight
miles in circumference; Seriphus<a id="FNanchor_2698" href="#Footnote_2698" class="fnanchor">2698</a>, twelve miles in
circuit; Prepesinthus<a id="FNanchor_2699" href="#Footnote_2699" class="fnanchor">2699</a>; Cythnos<a id="FNanchor_2700" href="#Footnote_2700" class="fnanchor">2700</a>; and then, by far the most
famous among the Cyclades, and lying in the very middle
of them, Delos<a id="FNanchor_2701" href="#Footnote_2701" class="fnanchor">2701</a> itself, so famous for its temple of Apollo,
and its extensive commerce. This island long floated on the
waves, and, as tradition says, was the only one that had never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
experienced an earthquake, down to the time of M. Varro<a id="FNanchor_2702" href="#Footnote_2702" class="fnanchor">2702</a>;
Mucianus however has informed us, that it has been twice
so visited. Aristotle states that this island received its
name from the fact of its having so suddenly made its
appearance<a id="FNanchor_2703" href="#Footnote_2703" class="fnanchor">2703</a> on emerging from the sea; Aglaosthenes, however,
gives it the name of Cynthia, and others of Ortygia<a id="FNanchor_2704" href="#Footnote_2704" class="fnanchor">2704</a>,
Asteria, Lagia, Chlamydia, Cynthus, and, from the circumstance
of fire having been first discovered here, Pyrpile. Its
circumference is five miles only; Mount Cynthus<a id="FNanchor_2705" href="#Footnote_2705" class="fnanchor">2705</a> here
raises his head.</p>

<p>Next to this island is Rhene<a id="FNanchor_2706" href="#Footnote_2706" class="fnanchor">2706</a>, which Anticlides calls by
the name of Celadussa, and Callidemus, Artemite; Scyros<a id="FNanchor_2707" href="#Footnote_2707" class="fnanchor">2707</a>,
which the old writers have stated to be twenty miles in circumference,
but Mucianus 160; Oliaros<a id="FNanchor_2708" href="#Footnote_2708" class="fnanchor">2708</a>; and Paros<a id="FNanchor_2709" href="#Footnote_2709" class="fnanchor">2709</a>, with
a city of the same name, distant from Delos thirty-eight
miles, and famous for its marble<a id="FNanchor_2710" href="#Footnote_2710" class="fnanchor">2710</a>; it was first called Platea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
and after that, Minois. At a distance of seven miles from
this last island is Naxos<a id="FNanchor_2711" href="#Footnote_2711" class="fnanchor">2711</a>, with a town of the same name;
it is eighteen miles distant from Delos. This island was
formerly called Strongyle<a id="FNanchor_2712" href="#Footnote_2712" class="fnanchor">2712</a>, then Dia, and then Dionysias<a id="FNanchor_2713" href="#Footnote_2713" class="fnanchor">2713</a>,
in consequence of the fruitfulness of its vineyards; others
again have called it the Lesser Sicily, or Callipolis<a id="FNanchor_2714" href="#Footnote_2714" class="fnanchor">2714</a>. It is
seventy-five<a id="FNanchor_2715" href="#Footnote_2715" class="fnanchor">2715</a> miles in circumference—half as large again as
Paros.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_23">CHAP. 23.—THE SPORADES.</h3></div>

<p>The islands thus far are considered as belonging to the
Cyclades; the rest that follow are the Sporades<a id="FNanchor_2716" href="#Footnote_2716" class="fnanchor">2716</a>. These
are, Helene<a id="FNanchor_2717" href="#Footnote_2717" class="fnanchor">2717</a>, Phacussa, Nicasia, Schinussa, Pholegandros,
and, at a distance of thirty-eight miles from Naxos, Icaros<a id="FNanchor_2718" href="#Footnote_2718" class="fnanchor">2718</a>,
which has given its name to the surrounding sea, and is the
same number of miles in length<a id="FNanchor_2719" href="#Footnote_2719" class="fnanchor">2719</a>, with two cities, and a
third now no longer in existence: this island used formerly
to be called Doliche, Macris, and Ichthyoëssa<a id="FNanchor_2720" href="#Footnote_2720" class="fnanchor">2720</a>. It is situate
fifty miles to the north-east of Delos, and thirty-five from the
island of Samos. Between Eubœa and Andros, there is an
arm of the sea ten miles in width, and from Icaros to
Geræstus is a distance of 112<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> miles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span></p>

<p>After we pass these, no regular order can be well observed;
the rest must therefore be mentioned indiscriminately.
There is the island of Scyros<a id="FNanchor_2721" href="#Footnote_2721" class="fnanchor">2721</a>, and that of Ios<a id="FNanchor_2722" href="#Footnote_2722" class="fnanchor">2722</a>, eighteen miles
distant from Naxos, and deserving of all veneration for the
tomb there of Homer; it is twenty-five miles in length, and
was formerly known by the name of Phœnice; also Odia,
Oletandros, and Gyara<a id="FNanchor_2723" href="#Footnote_2723" class="fnanchor">2723</a>, with a city of the same name, the
island being twelve miles in circumference, and distant from
Andros sixty-two. At a distance of eighty miles from
Gyara is Syrnos, then Cynæthus, Telos<a id="FNanchor_2724" href="#Footnote_2724" class="fnanchor">2724</a>, noted for its unguents,
and by Callimachus called Agathussa, Donusa<a id="FNanchor_2725" href="#Footnote_2725" class="fnanchor">2725</a>,
Patmos<a id="FNanchor_2726" href="#Footnote_2726" class="fnanchor">2726</a>, thirty miles in circumference, the Corassiæ<a id="FNanchor_2727" href="#Footnote_2727" class="fnanchor">2727</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
Lebinthus<a id="FNanchor_2728" href="#Footnote_2728" class="fnanchor">2728</a>, Leros<a id="FNanchor_2729" href="#Footnote_2729" class="fnanchor">2729</a>, Cinara<a id="FNanchor_2730" href="#Footnote_2730" class="fnanchor">2730</a>; Sicinus<a id="FNanchor_2731" href="#Footnote_2731" class="fnanchor">2731</a>, formerly called Œnoë<a id="FNanchor_2732" href="#Footnote_2732" class="fnanchor">2732</a>;
Hieracia, also called Onus; Casos<a id="FNanchor_2733" href="#Footnote_2733" class="fnanchor">2733</a>, likewise called Astrabe;
Cimolus<a id="FNanchor_2734" href="#Footnote_2734" class="fnanchor">2734</a>, or Echinussa; and Melos<a id="FNanchor_2735" href="#Footnote_2735" class="fnanchor">2735</a>, with a city of that name,
which island Aristides calls Memblis, Aristotle Zephyria, Callimachus
Mimallis, Heraclides Siphis and Acytos. This last
is the most circular<a id="FNanchor_2736" href="#Footnote_2736" class="fnanchor">2736</a> in form of all these islands. After this
comes Machia, then Hypere, formerly Patage, or, as others
have it, Platage, but now called Amorgos<a id="FNanchor_2737" href="#Footnote_2737" class="fnanchor">2737</a>, Polyægos<a id="FNanchor_2738" href="#Footnote_2738" class="fnanchor">2738</a>,
Phyle, and Thera<a id="FNanchor_2739" href="#Footnote_2739" class="fnanchor">2739</a>, known as Calliste when it first sprang
from the waves. From this, at a later period, the island of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Therasia<a id="FNanchor_2740" href="#Footnote_2740" class="fnanchor">2740</a> was torn away, and between the two afterwards
arose Automate, also called Hiera, and Thia, which in our
own times came into existence in the vicinity of these islands.
Ios is distant from Thera twenty-five miles.</p>

<p>Next to these follow Lea, Ascania<a id="FNanchor_2741" href="#Footnote_2741" class="fnanchor">2741</a>, Anaphe<a id="FNanchor_2742" href="#Footnote_2742" class="fnanchor">2742</a>, Hippuris,
and Astypalæa<a id="FNanchor_2743" href="#Footnote_2743" class="fnanchor">2743</a>, a free state. This island is eighty-eight
miles in circumference, and 125 miles distant from Cadistus,
in Crete. From Astypalæa, Platea is distant sixty miles,
and Caminia thirty-eight from this last. We then come to
the islands of Azibintha, Lanise, Tragæa, Pharmacussa,
Techedia, Chalcia<a id="FNanchor_2744" href="#Footnote_2744" class="fnanchor">2744</a>, Calymna<a id="FNanchor_2745" href="#Footnote_2745" class="fnanchor">2745</a>, in which is the town of Coös,
Calymna, at a distance of twenty-five miles from which
is Carpathum<a id="FNanchor_2746" href="#Footnote_2746" class="fnanchor">2746</a>, which has given its name to the Carpathian
Sea. The distance thence to Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_2747" href="#Footnote_2747" class="fnanchor">2747</a>, in the direction of the
south-west wind, is fifty miles. From Carpathum to Casus
is seven miles, and from Casus to Sammonium, the promontory
of Crete, thirty<a id="FNanchor_2748" href="#Footnote_2748" class="fnanchor">2748</a>. In the Euripus of Eubœa, almost
at the very mouth of it, are the four islands called Petaliæ<a id="FNanchor_2749" href="#Footnote_2749" class="fnanchor">2749</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
and, at its outlet, Atalante<a id="FNanchor_2750" href="#Footnote_2750" class="fnanchor">2750</a>. The Cyclades and the Sporades
are bounded on the east by the Asiatic shores of the Icarian
Sea, on the west by the Attic shores of the Myrtoan Sea,
on the north by the Ægean, and on the south by the Cretan
and Carpathian seas, extending 700 miles in length, and 200
in breadth.</p>

<p>The Gulf of Pagasa<a id="FNanchor_2751" href="#Footnote_2751" class="fnanchor">2751</a> has in front of it Euthia<a id="FNanchor_2752" href="#Footnote_2752" class="fnanchor">2752</a>, Cicynethus<a id="FNanchor_2753" href="#Footnote_2753" class="fnanchor">2753</a>,
Scyros, previously mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2754" href="#Footnote_2754" class="fnanchor">2754</a>, and the very furthermost
of the Cyclades and Sporades, Gerontia and Scandila<a id="FNanchor_2755" href="#Footnote_2755" class="fnanchor">2755</a>; the
Gulf of Thermæ<a id="FNanchor_2756" href="#Footnote_2756" class="fnanchor">2756</a>, Iræsia, Solimnia, Eudemia, and Nea, which
last is sacred to Minerva. Athos has before it four islands;
Peparethus<a id="FNanchor_2757" href="#Footnote_2757" class="fnanchor">2757</a>, formerly called Evœnus, with a city of that name,
at a distance from Athos of nine miles; Sciathus<a id="FNanchor_2758" href="#Footnote_2758" class="fnanchor">2758</a>, at a
distance of fifteen, and Imbros<a id="FNanchor_2759" href="#Footnote_2759" class="fnanchor">2759</a>, with a city of the same
name, at a distance of eighty-eight miles. This last island
is distant from Mastusia, in the Chersonesus, twenty-five
miles; it is sixty-two<a id="FNanchor_2760" href="#Footnote_2760" class="fnanchor">2760</a> miles in circumference, and is washed
by the river Ilisus. At a distance of twenty-two miles from
it is Lemnos<a id="FNanchor_2761" href="#Footnote_2761" class="fnanchor">2761</a>, being distant from Mount Athos eighty-seven;
it is 112 miles in circumference, and has the cities
of Hephæstia and Myrina<a id="FNanchor_2762" href="#Footnote_2762" class="fnanchor">2762</a>; into the market-place of which
last city Athos throws its shadow at the summer solstice.
The island of Thasos<a id="FNanchor_2763" href="#Footnote_2763" class="fnanchor">2763</a>, constituting a free state, is six miles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
distant from Lemnos; it formerly had the name of Aëria,
or Æthria. Abdera<a id="FNanchor_2764" href="#Footnote_2764" class="fnanchor">2764</a>, on the mainland, is distant from
Thasos twenty-two miles, Athos sixty-two<a id="FNanchor_2765" href="#Footnote_2765" class="fnanchor">2765</a>. The island of
Samothrace<a id="FNanchor_2766" href="#Footnote_2766" class="fnanchor">2766</a>, a free state, facing the river Hebrus, is the
same distance from Thasos, being also thirty-two<a id="FNanchor_2767" href="#Footnote_2767" class="fnanchor">2767</a> miles
from Imbros, twenty-two from Lemnos, and thirty-eight<a id="FNanchor_2768" href="#Footnote_2768" class="fnanchor">2768</a>
from the coast of Thrace; it is thirty-two miles in circumference,
and in it rises Mount Saoce<a id="FNanchor_2769" href="#Footnote_2769" class="fnanchor">2769</a>, ten miles in height.
This island is the most inaccessible of them all. Callimachus
mentions it by its ancient name of Dardania.</p>

<p>Between the Chersonesus and Samothrace, at a distance
of about fifteen miles from them both, is the island of
Halonnesos<a id="FNanchor_2770" href="#Footnote_2770" class="fnanchor">2770</a>, and beyond it Gethone, Lamponia, and Alopeconnesus<a id="FNanchor_2771" href="#Footnote_2771" class="fnanchor">2771</a>,
not far from Cœlos, a port<a id="FNanchor_2772" href="#Footnote_2772" class="fnanchor">2772</a> of the Chersonesus,
besides some others of no importance. The following names
may be also mentioned, as those of uninhabited islands in
this gulf, of which we have been enabled to discover the
names:—Desticos, Sarnos, Cyssiros, Charbrusa, Calathusa,
Scylla, Draconon, Arconnesus, Diethusa, Scapos, Capheris,
Mesate, Æantion, Pateronnesos, Pateria, Calate, Neriphus,
and Polendos<a id="FNanchor_2773" href="#Footnote_2773" class="fnanchor">2773</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_24">CHAP. 24.—THE HELLESPONT.—THE LAKE MÆOTIS.</h3></div>

<p>The fourth great Gulf of Europe begins at the Hellespont
and ends at the entrance of the Mæotis<a id="FNanchor_2774" href="#Footnote_2774" class="fnanchor">2774</a>. But in order
that the several portions of the Euxine and its coasts may
be the better known, we must briefly embrace the form
of it in one general view. This vast sea, lying in front of
Asia, is shut out from Europe by the projection of the shores
of the Chersonesus, and effects an entrance into those countries
by a narrow channel only, of the width, as already
mentioned, of seven stadia, thus separating Europe from
Asia. The entrance of these Straits is called the Hellespont;
over it Xerxes, the king of the Persians, constructed
a bridge of boats, across which he led his army.
A narrow channel extends thence a distance of eighty-six
miles, as far as Priapus<a id="FNanchor_2775" href="#Footnote_2775" class="fnanchor">2775</a>, a city of Asia, at which Alexander
the Great passed over. At this point the sea becomes
wider, and after some distance again takes the form of a
narrow strait. The wider part is known as the Propontis<a id="FNanchor_2776" href="#Footnote_2776" class="fnanchor">2776</a>,
the Straits as the Thracian Bosporus<a id="FNanchor_2777" href="#Footnote_2777" class="fnanchor">2777</a>, being only half-a-mile
in width, at the place where Darius, the father of
Xerxes, led his troops across by a bridge. The extremity of
this is distant from the Hellespont 239 miles.</p>

<p>We then come to the vast sea called the Euxine, which
invades the land as it retreats afar, and the name of which
was formerly Axenus<a id="FNanchor_2778" href="#Footnote_2778" class="fnanchor">2778</a>. As the shores bend inwards, this
sea with a vast sweep stretches far away, curving on both
sides after the manner of a pair of horns, so much so that in
shape it bears a distinct resemblance to a Scythian bow<a id="FNanchor_2779" href="#Footnote_2779" class="fnanchor">2779</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
In the middle of the curve it is joined by the mouth of
Lake Mæotis, which is called the Cimmerian<a id="FNanchor_2780" href="#Footnote_2780" class="fnanchor">2780</a> Bosporus,
and is two miles and a half in width. Between the two
Bospori, the Thracian and the Cimmerian, there is a distance
in a straight line, of 500 miles, as Polybius informs us. We
learn from Varro and most of the ancient writers, that the
circumference of the Euxine is altogether 2150 miles; but
to this number Cornelius Nepos adds 350 more; while
Artemidorus makes it 2919 miles, Agrippa 2360, and Mucianus
2425. In a similar manner some writers have fixed
the length of the European shores of this sea at 1478 miles,
others again at 1172. M. Varro gives the measurement as
follows:—from the mouth of the Euxine to Apollonia 187
miles, and to Callatis the same distance; thence to the
mouth of the Ister 125 miles; to the Borysthenes 250; to
Chersonesus<a id="FNanchor_2781" href="#Footnote_2781" class="fnanchor">2781</a>, a town of the Heracleotæ, 325; to Panticapæum<a id="FNanchor_2782" href="#Footnote_2782" class="fnanchor">2782</a>,
by some called Bosporus, at the very extremity of
the shores of Europe, 212 miles: the whole of which added
together, makes 1337<a id="FNanchor_2783" href="#Footnote_2783" class="fnanchor">2783</a> miles. Agrippa makes the distance
from Byzantium to the river Ister 560 miles, and from
thence to Panticapæum, 635.</p>

<p>Lake Mæotis, which receives the river Tanais as it flows
from the Riphæan Mountains<a id="FNanchor_2784" href="#Footnote_2784" class="fnanchor">2784</a>, and forms the extreme boundary
between Europe and Asia, is said to be 1406 miles in
circumference; which however some writers state at only
1125. From the entrance of this lake to the mouth of the
Tanais in a straight line is, it is generally agreed, a distance
of 375 miles.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the coasts of this fourth great Gulf of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Europe, as far as Istropolis, have been already<a id="FNanchor_2785" href="#Footnote_2785" class="fnanchor">2785</a> mentioned in
our account of Thrace. Passing beyond that spot we come
to the mouths of the Ister. This river rises in Germany in
the heights of Mount Abnoba<a id="FNanchor_2786" href="#Footnote_2786" class="fnanchor">2786</a>, opposite to Rauricum<a id="FNanchor_2787" href="#Footnote_2787" class="fnanchor">2787</a>, a
town of Gaul, and flows for a course of many miles beyond
the Alps and through nations innumerable, under the name
of the Danube. Adding immensely to the volume of its
waters, at the spot where it first enters Illyricum, it assumes
the name of Ister, and, after receiving sixty rivers, nearly
one half of which are navigable, rolls into the Euxine by
six<a id="FNanchor_2788" href="#Footnote_2788" class="fnanchor">2788</a> vast channels. The first of these is the mouth of
Peuce<a id="FNanchor_2789" href="#Footnote_2789" class="fnanchor">2789</a>, close to which is the island of Peuce itself, from
which the neighbouring channel takes its name; this mouth
is swallowed up in a great swamp nineteen miles in length.
From the same channel too, above Istropolis, a lake<a id="FNanchor_2790" href="#Footnote_2790" class="fnanchor">2790</a> takes
its rise, sixty-three miles in circuit; its name is Halmyris.
The second mouth is called Naracu-Stoma<a id="FNanchor_2791" href="#Footnote_2791" class="fnanchor">2791</a>; the third, which
is near the island of Sarmatica, is called Calon-Stoma<a id="FNanchor_2792" href="#Footnote_2792" class="fnanchor">2792</a>; the
fourth is known as Pseudo-Stomon<a id="FNanchor_2793" href="#Footnote_2793" class="fnanchor">2793</a>, with its island
called Conopon-Diabasis<a id="FNanchor_2794" href="#Footnote_2794" class="fnanchor">2794</a>; after which come the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
Boreon-Stoma<a id="FNanchor_2795" href="#Footnote_2795" class="fnanchor">2795</a> and the Psilon-Stoma<a id="FNanchor_2796" href="#Footnote_2796" class="fnanchor">2796</a>. These mouths are each of
them so considerable, that for a distance of forty miles, it is
said, the saltness of the sea is quite overpowered, and the
water found to be fresh.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_25">CHAP. 25.—DACIA, SARMATIA.</h3></div>

<p>On setting out from this spot, all the nations met
with are Scythian in general, though various races have
occupied the adjacent shores; at one spot the Getæ<a id="FNanchor_2797" href="#Footnote_2797" class="fnanchor">2797</a>, by the
Romans called Daci; at another the Sarmatæ, by the Greeks
called Sauromatæ, and the Hamaxobii<a id="FNanchor_2798" href="#Footnote_2798" class="fnanchor">2798</a> or Aorsi, a branch
of them; then again the base-born Scythians and descendants
of slaves, or else the Troglodytæ<a id="FNanchor_2799" href="#Footnote_2799" class="fnanchor">2799</a>; and then, after
them, the Alani<a id="FNanchor_2800" href="#Footnote_2800" class="fnanchor">2800</a> and the Rhoxalani. The higher<a id="FNanchor_2801" href="#Footnote_2801" class="fnanchor">2801</a> parts
again, between the Danube and the Hercynian Forest<a id="FNanchor_2802" href="#Footnote_2802" class="fnanchor">2802</a>, as
far as the winter quarters of Pannonia at Carnuntum<a id="FNanchor_2803" href="#Footnote_2803" class="fnanchor">2803</a>, and
the borders of the Germans, are occupied by the Sarmatian
Iazyges<a id="FNanchor_2804" href="#Footnote_2804" class="fnanchor">2804</a>, who inhabit the level country and the plains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
while the Daci, whom they have driven as far as the river
Pathissus<a id="FNanchor_2805" href="#Footnote_2805" class="fnanchor">2805</a>, inhabit the mountain and forest ranges. On
leaving the river Marus<a id="FNanchor_2806" href="#Footnote_2806" class="fnanchor">2806</a>, whether it is that or the Duria<a id="FNanchor_2807" href="#Footnote_2807" class="fnanchor">2807</a>,
that separates them from the Suevi and the kingdom of
Vannius<a id="FNanchor_2808" href="#Footnote_2808" class="fnanchor">2808</a>, the Basternæ, and, after them, other tribes of
the Germans occupy the opposite sides<a id="FNanchor_2809" href="#Footnote_2809" class="fnanchor">2809</a>. Agrippa considers
the whole of this region, from the Ister to the ocean, to be
2100 miles in length, and 4400 miles in breadth to the river
Vistula in the deserts<a id="FNanchor_2810" href="#Footnote_2810" class="fnanchor">2810</a> of Sarmatia. The name “Scythian”
has extended, in every direction, even to the Sarmatæ and the
Germans; but this ancient appellation is now only given to
those who dwell beyond those nations, and live unknown to
nearly all the rest of the world.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_26">CHAP. 26.—SCYTHIA.</h3></div>

<p>Leaving the Ister, we come to the towns of Cremniscos<a id="FNanchor_2811" href="#Footnote_2811" class="fnanchor">2811</a>,
Æpolium, the mountains of Macrocremnus, and the famous
river Tyra<a id="FNanchor_2812" href="#Footnote_2812" class="fnanchor">2812</a>, which gives name to a town on the spot where
Ophiusa is said formerly to have stood. The Tyragetæ
inhabit a large island<a id="FNanchor_2813" href="#Footnote_2813" class="fnanchor">2813</a> situate in this river, which is distant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
from Pseudostomos, a mouth of the Ister, so called, 130
miles. We then come to the Axiacæ, who take their name
from the river Axiaces<a id="FNanchor_2814" href="#Footnote_2814" class="fnanchor">2814</a>, and beyond them, the Crobyzi, the
river Rhodes<a id="FNanchor_2815" href="#Footnote_2815" class="fnanchor">2815</a>, the Sagarian Gulf<a id="FNanchor_2816" href="#Footnote_2816" class="fnanchor">2816</a>, and the port of Ordesos<a id="FNanchor_2817" href="#Footnote_2817" class="fnanchor">2817</a>.
At a distance of 120 miles from the Tyra is the river Borysthenes<a id="FNanchor_2818" href="#Footnote_2818" class="fnanchor">2818</a>,
with a lake and a people of similar name, as also
a town<a id="FNanchor_2819" href="#Footnote_2819" class="fnanchor">2819</a> in the interior, at a distance of fifteen miles from the
sea, the ancient names of which were Olbiopolis and Miletopolis.
Again, on the shore is the port of the Achæi, and
the island of Achilles<a id="FNanchor_2820" href="#Footnote_2820" class="fnanchor">2820</a>, famous for the tomb there of that
hero, and, at a distance of 125 miles from it, a peninsula
which stretches forth in the shape of a sword, in an oblique
direction, and is called, from having been his place of exercise,
Dromos Achilleos<a id="FNanchor_2821" href="#Footnote_2821" class="fnanchor">2821</a>: the length of this, according to Agrippa,
is eighty miles. The Taurian Scythians and the Siraci<a id="FNanchor_2822" href="#Footnote_2822" class="fnanchor">2822</a>
occupy all this tract of country.</p>

<p>At this spot begins a well-wooded district<a id="FNanchor_2823" href="#Footnote_2823" class="fnanchor">2823</a>, which has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
given to the sea that washes its banks the name of the
Hylæan Sea; its inhabitants are called Enœchadlæ<a id="FNanchor_2824" href="#Footnote_2824" class="fnanchor">2824</a>. Beyond
them is the river Panticapes<a id="FNanchor_2825" href="#Footnote_2825" class="fnanchor">2825</a>, which separates the
Nomades<a id="FNanchor_2826" href="#Footnote_2826" class="fnanchor">2826</a> and the Georgi, and after it the Acesinus<a id="FNanchor_2827" href="#Footnote_2827" class="fnanchor">2827</a>. Some
authors say that the Panticapes flows into the Borysthenes
below Olbia<a id="FNanchor_2828" href="#Footnote_2828" class="fnanchor">2828</a>. Others, who are more correct, say that it is
the Hypanis<a id="FNanchor_2829" href="#Footnote_2829" class="fnanchor">2829</a>: so great is the mistake made by those who
have placed it<a id="FNanchor_2830" href="#Footnote_2830" class="fnanchor">2830</a> in Asia.</p>

<p>The sea runs in here and forms a large gulf<a id="FNanchor_2831" href="#Footnote_2831" class="fnanchor">2831</a>, until there
is only an intervening space<a id="FNanchor_2832" href="#Footnote_2832" class="fnanchor">2832</a> of five miles between it and the
Lake Mæotis, its margin forming the sea-line of extensive
tracts of land, and numerous nations; it is known as the Gulf
of Carcinites. Here we find the river Pacyris<a id="FNanchor_2833" href="#Footnote_2833" class="fnanchor">2833</a>, the towns of
Navarum and Carcine<a id="FNanchor_2834" href="#Footnote_2834" class="fnanchor">2834</a>, and behind it Lake Buges<a id="FNanchor_2835" href="#Footnote_2835" class="fnanchor">2835</a>, which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
discharges itself by a channel into the sea. This Buges is
separated by a ridge of rocks<a id="FNanchor_2836" href="#Footnote_2836" class="fnanchor">2836</a> from Coretus, a gulf in the
Lake Mæotis; it receives the rivers Buges<a id="FNanchor_2837" href="#Footnote_2837" class="fnanchor">2837</a>, Gerrus<a id="FNanchor_2838" href="#Footnote_2838" class="fnanchor">2838</a>, and
Hypacaris<a id="FNanchor_2839" href="#Footnote_2839" class="fnanchor">2839</a>, which approach it from regions that lie in
various directions. For the Gerrus separates the Basilidæ
from the Nomades, the Hypacaris flows through the Nomades
and the Hylæi, by an artificial channel into Lake
Buges, and by its natural one into the Gulf of Coretus:
this region bears the name of Scythia Sindice.</p>

<p>At the river Carcinites, Scythia Taurica<a id="FNanchor_2840" href="#Footnote_2840" class="fnanchor">2840</a> begins, which
was once covered by the sea, where we now see level
plains extended on every side: beyond this the land rises into
mountains of great elevation. The peoples here are thirty
in number, of which twenty-three dwell in the interior, six
of the cities being inhabited by the Orgocyni, the Characeni<a id="FNanchor_2841" href="#Footnote_2841" class="fnanchor">2841</a>,
the Lagyrani, the Tractari, the Arsilachitæ, and the
Caliordi. The Scythotauri possess the range of mountains:
on the west they are bounded by the Chersonesus, and on
the east by the Scythian Satarchæ<a id="FNanchor_2842" href="#Footnote_2842" class="fnanchor">2842</a>. On the shore, after
we leave Carcinites, we find the following towns; Taphræ<a id="FNanchor_2843" href="#Footnote_2843" class="fnanchor">2843</a>,
situate on the very isthmus of the peninsula, and
then Heraclea Chersonesus<a id="FNanchor_2844" href="#Footnote_2844" class="fnanchor">2844</a>, to which its freedom has been
granted<a id="FNanchor_2845" href="#Footnote_2845" class="fnanchor">2845</a> by the Romans. This place was formerly called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
Megarice, being the most polished city throughout all these
regions, in consequence of its strict preservation of Grecian
manners and customs. A wall, five miles in length, surrounds
it. Next to this comes the Promontory of Parthenium<a id="FNanchor_2846" href="#Footnote_2846" class="fnanchor">2846</a>,
the city of the Tauri, Placia, the port of the Symboli<a id="FNanchor_2847" href="#Footnote_2847" class="fnanchor">2847</a>,
and the Promontory of Criumetopon<a id="FNanchor_2848" href="#Footnote_2848" class="fnanchor">2848</a>, opposite to
Carambis<a id="FNanchor_2849" href="#Footnote_2849" class="fnanchor">2849</a>, a promontory of Asia, which runs out in the
middle of the Euxine, leaving an intervening space between
them of 170 miles, which circumstance it is in especial that
gives to this sea the form of a Scythian bow. After leaving
this headland we come to a great number of harbours and
lakes of the Tauri<a id="FNanchor_2850" href="#Footnote_2850" class="fnanchor">2850</a>. The town of Theodosia<a id="FNanchor_2851" href="#Footnote_2851" class="fnanchor">2851</a> is distant
from Criumetopon 125 miles, and from Chersonesus 165.
Beyond it there were, in former times, the towns of Cytæ,
Zephyrium, Acræ, Nymphæum, and Dia. Panticapæum<a id="FNanchor_2852" href="#Footnote_2852" class="fnanchor">2852</a>, a
city of the Milesians, by far the strongest of them all, is
still in existence; it lies at the entrance of the Bosporus,
and is distant from Theodosia eighty-seven miles and a half,
and from the town of Cimmerium, which lies on the other
side of the Strait, as we have previously<a id="FNanchor_2853" href="#Footnote_2853" class="fnanchor">2853</a> stated, two miles
and a half. Such is the width here of the channel which
separates Asia from Europe, and which too, from being
generally quite frozen over, allows of a passage on foot.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
The width of the Cimmerian Bosporus<a id="FNanchor_2854" href="#Footnote_2854" class="fnanchor">2854</a> is twelve miles and
a half: it contains the towns of Hermisium<a id="FNanchor_2855" href="#Footnote_2855" class="fnanchor">2855</a>, Myrmecium,
and, in the interior<a id="FNanchor_2856" href="#Footnote_2856" class="fnanchor">2856</a> of it, the island of Alopece. From the
spot called Taphræ<a id="FNanchor_2857" href="#Footnote_2857" class="fnanchor">2857</a>, at the extremity of the isthmus, to the
mouth of the Bosporus, along the line of the Lake Mæotis,
is a distance of 260 miles.</p>

<p>Leaving Taphræ, and going along the mainland, we find
in the interior the Auchetæ<a id="FNanchor_2858" href="#Footnote_2858" class="fnanchor">2858</a>, in whose country the Hypanis
has its rise, as also the Neurœ, in whose district the Borysthenes
has its source, the Geloni<a id="FNanchor_2859" href="#Footnote_2859" class="fnanchor">2859</a>, the Thyssagetæ, the Budini,
the Basilidæ, and the Agathyrsi<a id="FNanchor_2860" href="#Footnote_2860" class="fnanchor">2860</a> with their azure-coloured
hair. Above them are the Nomades, and then a nation of
Anthropophagi or cannibals. On leaving Lake Buges, above
the Lake Mæotis we come to the Sauromatæ and the Essedones<a id="FNanchor_2861" href="#Footnote_2861" class="fnanchor">2861</a>.
Along the coast, as far as the river Tanais<a id="FNanchor_2862" href="#Footnote_2862" class="fnanchor">2862</a>, are<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
the Mæotæ, from whom the lake derives its name, and the
last of all, in the rear of them, the Arimaspi. We then
come to the Riphæan<a id="FNanchor_2863" href="#Footnote_2863" class="fnanchor">2863</a> mountains, and the region known by
the name of Pterophoros<a id="FNanchor_2864" href="#Footnote_2864" class="fnanchor">2864</a>, because of the perpetual fall of
snow there, the flakes of which resemble feathers; a part of
the world which has been condemned by the decree of
nature to lie immersed in thick darkness; suited for nothing
but the generation of cold, and to be the asylum of the
chilling blasts of the northern winds.</p>

<p>Behind these mountains, and beyond the region of the
northern winds, there dwells, if we choose to believe it, a
happy race, known as the Hyperborei<a id="FNanchor_2865" href="#Footnote_2865" class="fnanchor">2865</a>, a race that lives to an
extreme old age, and which has been the subject of many marvellous
stories<a id="FNanchor_2866" href="#Footnote_2866" class="fnanchor">2866</a>. At this spot are supposed to be the hinges
upon which the world revolves, and the extreme limits of the
revolutions of the stars. Here we find light for six months
together, given by the sun in one continuous day, who does
not, however, as some ignorant persons have asserted, conceal
himself from the vernal equinox<a id="FNanchor_2867" href="#Footnote_2867" class="fnanchor">2867</a> to autumn. On the contrary,
to these people there is but one rising of the sun for the year,
and that at the summer solstice, and but one setting, at the
winter solstice. This region, warmed by the rays of the
sun, is of a most delightful temperature, and exempt from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
every noxious blast. The abodes of the natives are the
woods and groves; the gods receive their worship singly
and in groups, while all discord and every kind of sickness
are things utterly unknown. Death comes upon them
only when satiated with life; after a career of feasting,
in an old age sated with every luxury, they leap from a
certain rock there into the sea; and this they deem the
most desirable mode of ending existence. Some writers have
placed these people, not in Europe, but at the very verge of
the shores of Asia, because we find there a people called the
Attacori<a id="FNanchor_2868" href="#Footnote_2868" class="fnanchor">2868</a>, who greatly resemble them and occupy a very
similar locality. Other writers again have placed them midway
between the two suns, at the spot where it sets to the
Antipodes and rises to us; a thing however that cannot
possibly be, in consequence of the vast tract of sea which
there intervenes. Those writers who place them nowhere<a id="FNanchor_2869" href="#Footnote_2869" class="fnanchor">2869</a>
but under a day which lasts for six months, state that in the
morning they sow, at mid-day they reap, at sunset they
gather in the fruits of the trees, and during the night conceal
themselves in caves. Nor are we at liberty to entertain any
doubts as to the existence of this race; so many authors<a id="FNanchor_2870" href="#Footnote_2870" class="fnanchor">2870</a>
are there who assert that they were in the habit of sending
their first-fruits to Delos to present them to Apollo, whom
in especial they worship. Virgins used to carry them, who
for many years were held in high veneration, and received
the rites of hospitality from the nations that lay on the
route; until at last, in consequence of repeated violations
of good faith, the Hyperboreans came to the determination
to deposit these offerings upon the frontiers of the people
who adjoined them, and they in their turn were to convey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
them on to their neighbours, and so from one to the other,
till they should have arrived at Delos. However, this
custom, even, in time fell into disuse.</p>

<p>The length of Sarmatia, Scythia, and Taurica, and of the
whole of the region which extends from the river Borysthenes,
is, according to Agrippa, 980 miles, and its breadth
717. I am of opinion, however, that in this part of the
earth all estimates of measurement are exceedingly doubtful.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_27">CHAP. 27.—THE ISLANDS OF THE EUXINE. THE ISLANDS
OF THE NORTHERN OCEAN.</h3></div>

<p>But now, in conformity with the plan which I originally
proposed, the remaining portions of this gulf must be described.
As for its seas, we have already made mention of
them.</p>

<p>(13.) The Hellespont has no islands belonging to Europe
that are worthy of mention. In the Euxine there are, at a
distance of a mile and a half from the European shore, and
of fourteen from the mouth of the Strait, the two Cyanæan<a id="FNanchor_2871" href="#Footnote_2871" class="fnanchor">2871</a>
islands, by some called the Symplegades<a id="FNanchor_2872" href="#Footnote_2872" class="fnanchor">2872</a>, and stated in fabulous
story to have run the one against the other; the reason
being the circumstance that they are separated by so short
an interval, that while to those who enter the Euxine opposite
to them they appear to be two distinct islands, but if viewed
in a somewhat oblique direction they have the appearance of
becoming gradually united into one. On this side of the
Ister there is the single island<a id="FNanchor_2873" href="#Footnote_2873" class="fnanchor">2873</a> of the Apolloniates, eighty
miles from the Thracian Bosporus; it was from this place
that M. Lucullus brought the Capitoline<a id="FNanchor_2874" href="#Footnote_2874" class="fnanchor">2874</a> Apollo. Those<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
islands which are to be found between the mouths of the
Ister we have already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_2875" href="#Footnote_2875" class="fnanchor">2875</a>. Before the Borysthenes
is Achillea<a id="FNanchor_2876" href="#Footnote_2876" class="fnanchor">2876</a> previously referred to, known also by the names
of Leuce and Macaron<a id="FNanchor_2877" href="#Footnote_2877" class="fnanchor">2877</a>. Researches which have been made
at the present day place this island at a distance of 140 miles
from the Borysthenes, of 120 from Tyra, and of fifty from
the island of Peuce. It is about ten miles in circumference.
The remaining islands in the Gulf of Carcinites are Cephalonnesos,
Rhosphodusa, and Macra. Before we leave the
Euxine, we must not omit to notice the opinion expressed
by many writers that all the interior<a id="FNanchor_2878" href="#Footnote_2878" class="fnanchor">2878</a> seas take their rise in
this one as the principal source, and not at the Straits of
Gades. The reason they give for this supposition is not an
improbable one—the fact that the tide is always running
out of the Euxine and that there is never any ebb.</p>

<p>We must now leave the Euxine to describe the outer portions<a id="FNanchor_2879" href="#Footnote_2879" class="fnanchor">2879</a>
of Europe. After passing the Riphæan mountains we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
have now to follow the shores of the Northern Ocean on the
left, until we arrive at Gades. In this direction a great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
number of islands<a id="FNanchor_2880" href="#Footnote_2880" class="fnanchor">2880</a> are said to exist that have no name; among
which there is one which lies opposite to Scythia, mentioned
under the name of Raunonia<a id="FNanchor_2881" href="#Footnote_2881" class="fnanchor">2881</a>, and said to be at a distance
of the day’s sail from the mainland; and upon which, according
to Timæus, amber is thrown up by the waves in the spring
season. As to the remaining parts of these shores, they are
only known from reports of doubtful authority. With reference
to the Septentrional<a id="FNanchor_2882" href="#Footnote_2882" class="fnanchor">2882</a> or Northern Ocean; Hecatæus
calls it, after we have passed the mouth of the river Parapanisus,
where it washes the Scythian shores, the Amalchian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
sea, the word ‘Amalchian’ signifying in the language of these
races, frozen. Philemon again says that it is called Morimarusa
or the “Dead Sea” by the Cimbri, as far as the Promontory
of Rubeas, beyond which it has the name of the Cronian<a id="FNanchor_2883" href="#Footnote_2883" class="fnanchor">2883</a>
Sea. Xenophon of Lampsacus tells us that at a distance
of three days’ sail from the shores of Scythia, there is an
island of immense size called Baltia<a id="FNanchor_2884" href="#Footnote_2884" class="fnanchor">2884</a>, which by Pytheas is
called Basilia<a id="FNanchor_2885" href="#Footnote_2885" class="fnanchor">2885</a>. Some islands<a id="FNanchor_2886" href="#Footnote_2886" class="fnanchor">2886</a> called Oönæ are said to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
here, the inhabitants of which live on the eggs of birds
and oats; and others again upon which human beings
are produced with the feet of horses, thence called Hippopodes.
Some other islands are also mentioned as those of
the Panotii, the people of which have ears of such extraordinary
size as to cover the rest of the body, which is
otherwise left naked.</p>

<p>Leaving these however, we come to the nation of the Ingævones<a id="FNanchor_2887" href="#Footnote_2887" class="fnanchor">2887</a>,
the first in Germany; at which we begin to have
some information upon which more implicit reliance can be
placed. In their country is an immense mountain called
Sevo<a id="FNanchor_2888" href="#Footnote_2888" class="fnanchor">2888</a>, not less than those of the Riphæan range, and which
forms an immense gulf along the shore as far as the Promontory
of the Cimbri. This gulf, which has the name of the
‘Codanian,’ is filled with islands; the most famous among
which is Scandinavia<a id="FNanchor_2889" href="#Footnote_2889" class="fnanchor">2889</a>, of a magnitude as yet unascertained:
the only portion of it at all known is inhabited by the nation
of the Hilleviones, who dwell in 500 villages, and call it a
second world: it is generally supposed that the island of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
Eningia<a id="FNanchor_2890" href="#Footnote_2890" class="fnanchor">2890</a> is of not less magnitude. Some writers state that
these regions, as far as the river Vistula, are inhabited by the
Sarmati, the Venedi<a id="FNanchor_2891" href="#Footnote_2891" class="fnanchor">2891</a>, the Sciri, and the Hirri<a id="FNanchor_2892" href="#Footnote_2892" class="fnanchor">2892</a>, and that there
is a gulf there known by the name of Cylipenus<a id="FNanchor_2893" href="#Footnote_2893" class="fnanchor">2893</a>, at the mouth
of which is the island of Latris, after which comes another
gulf, that of Lagnus, which borders on the Cimbri. The
Cimbrian Promontory, running out into the sea for a great
distance, forms a peninsula which bears the name of Cartris<a id="FNanchor_2894" href="#Footnote_2894" class="fnanchor">2894</a>.
Passing this coast, there are three and twenty islands which
have been made known by the Roman arms<a id="FNanchor_2895" href="#Footnote_2895" class="fnanchor">2895</a>: the most
famous of which is Burcana<a id="FNanchor_2896" href="#Footnote_2896" class="fnanchor">2896</a>, called by our people Fabaria,
from the resemblance borne<a id="FNanchor_2897" href="#Footnote_2897" class="fnanchor">2897</a> by a fruit which grows there
spontaneously. There are those also called Glæsaria<a id="FNanchor_2898" href="#Footnote_2898" class="fnanchor">2898</a> by our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
soldiers, from their amber; but by the barbarians they are
known as Austeravia and Actania.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_28">CHAP. 28.—GERMANY.</h3></div>

<p>The whole of the shores of this sea as far as the Scaldis<a id="FNanchor_2899" href="#Footnote_2899" class="fnanchor">2899</a>,
a river of Germany, is inhabited by nations, the dimensions
of whose respective territories it is quite impossible to state,
so immensely do the authors differ who have touched upon
this subject. The Greek writers and some of our own
countrymen have stated the coast of Germany to be 2500
miles in extent, while Agrippa, comprising Rhætia and Noricum
in his estimate, makes the length to be 686<a id="FNanchor_2900" href="#Footnote_2900" class="fnanchor">2900</a> miles, and
the breadth 148<a id="FNanchor_2901" href="#Footnote_2901" class="fnanchor">2901</a>. (14.) The breadth of Rhætia alone however
very nearly exceeds that number of miles, and indeed
we ought to state that it was only subjugated at about the
period of the death of that general; while as for Germany,
the whole of it was not thoroughly known to us for many
years after his time. If I may be allowed to form a conjecture,
the margin of the coast will be found to be not far short
of the estimate of the Greek writers, while the distance in a
straight line will nearly correspond with that mentioned by
Agrippa.</p>

<p>There are five German races; the Vandili<a id="FNanchor_2902" href="#Footnote_2902" class="fnanchor">2902</a>, parts of whom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
are the Burgundiones<a id="FNanchor_2903" href="#Footnote_2903" class="fnanchor">2903</a>, the Varini<a id="FNanchor_2904" href="#Footnote_2904" class="fnanchor">2904</a>, the Carini<a id="FNanchor_2905" href="#Footnote_2905" class="fnanchor">2905</a>, and the
Gutones<a id="FNanchor_2906" href="#Footnote_2906" class="fnanchor">2906</a>: the Ingævones, forming a second race, a portion
of whom are the Cimbri<a id="FNanchor_2907" href="#Footnote_2907" class="fnanchor">2907</a>, the Teutoni<a id="FNanchor_2908" href="#Footnote_2908" class="fnanchor">2908</a>, and the tribes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
of the Chauci<a id="FNanchor_2909" href="#Footnote_2909" class="fnanchor">2909</a>. The Istævones<a id="FNanchor_2910" href="#Footnote_2910" class="fnanchor">2910</a>, who join up to the Rhine,
and to whom the Cimbri<a id="FNanchor_2911" href="#Footnote_2911" class="fnanchor">2911</a> belong, are the third race; while
the Hermiones, forming a fourth, dwell in the interior,
and include the Suevi<a id="FNanchor_2912" href="#Footnote_2912" class="fnanchor">2912</a>, the Hermunduri<a id="FNanchor_2913" href="#Footnote_2913" class="fnanchor">2913</a>, the Chatti<a id="FNanchor_2914" href="#Footnote_2914" class="fnanchor">2914</a>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
the Cherusci<a id="FNanchor_2915" href="#Footnote_2915" class="fnanchor">2915</a>: the fifth race is that of the Peucini<a id="FNanchor_2916" href="#Footnote_2916" class="fnanchor">2916</a>, who are
also the Basternæ, adjoining the Daci previously mentioned.
The more famous rivers that flow into the ocean are the
Guttalus<a id="FNanchor_2917" href="#Footnote_2917" class="fnanchor">2917</a>, the Vistillus or Vistula, the Albis<a id="FNanchor_2918" href="#Footnote_2918" class="fnanchor">2918</a>, the Visurgis<a id="FNanchor_2919" href="#Footnote_2919" class="fnanchor">2919</a>,
the Amisius<a id="FNanchor_2920" href="#Footnote_2920" class="fnanchor">2920</a>, the Rhine, and the Mosa<a id="FNanchor_2921" href="#Footnote_2921" class="fnanchor">2921</a>. In the interior is
the long extent of the Hercynian<a id="FNanchor_2922" href="#Footnote_2922" class="fnanchor">2922</a> range, which in grandeur
is inferior to none.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_29">CHAP. 29. (15.)—NINETY-SIX ISLANDS OF THE GALLIC OCEAN.</h3></div>

<p>In the Rhine itself, nearly 100 miles in length, is the
most famous island<a id="FNanchor_2923" href="#Footnote_2923" class="fnanchor">2923</a> of the Batavi and the Canninefates, as
also other islands of the Frisii<a id="FNanchor_2924" href="#Footnote_2924" class="fnanchor">2924</a>, the Chauci, the Frisiabones<a id="FNanchor_2925" href="#Footnote_2925" class="fnanchor">2925</a>,
the Sturii<a id="FNanchor_2926" href="#Footnote_2926" class="fnanchor">2926</a>, and the Marsacii, which lie between Helium<a id="FNanchor_2927" href="#Footnote_2927" class="fnanchor">2927</a> and Flevum<a id="FNanchor_2928" href="#Footnote_2928" class="fnanchor">2928</a>.
These are the names of the mouths<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
into which the Rhine divides itself, discharging its waters on
the north into the lakes there, and on the west into the river
Mosa. At the middle mouth which lies between these two,
the river, having but a very small channel, preserves its own
name.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_30">CHAP. 30. (16.)—BRITANNIA.</h3></div>

<p>Opposite to this coast is the island called Britannia, so
celebrated in the records of Greece<a id="FNanchor_2929" href="#Footnote_2929" class="fnanchor">2929</a> and of our own country.
It is situate to the north-west, and, with a large tract of
intervening sea, lies opposite to Germany, Gaul, and Spain,
by far the greater part of Europe. Its former name was
Albion<a id="FNanchor_2930" href="#Footnote_2930" class="fnanchor">2930</a>; but at a later period, all the islands, of which we
shall just now briefly make mention, were included under the
name of “Britanniæ.” This island is distant from Gesoriacum,
on the coast of the nation of the Morini<a id="FNanchor_2931" href="#Footnote_2931" class="fnanchor">2931</a>, at the spot where
the passage across is the shortest, fifty miles. Pytheas and
Isidorus say that its circumference is 4875 miles. It is
barely thirty years since any extensive knowledge of it was
gained by the successes of the Roman arms, and even as yet
they have not penetrated beyond the vicinity of the Caledonian<a id="FNanchor_2932" href="#Footnote_2932" class="fnanchor">2932</a>
forest. Agrippa believes its length to be 800 miles, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
its breadth 300; he also thinks that the breadth of Hibernia
is the same, but that its length is less by 200 miles. This
last island is situate beyond Britannia, the passage across
being the shortest from the territory of the Silures<a id="FNanchor_2933" href="#Footnote_2933" class="fnanchor">2933</a>, a distance
of thirty miles. Of the remaining islands none is said to
have a greater circumference than 125 miles. Among these
there are the Orcades<a id="FNanchor_2934" href="#Footnote_2934" class="fnanchor">2934</a>, forty in number, and situate within
a short distance of each other, the seven islands called Acmodæ<a id="FNanchor_2935" href="#Footnote_2935" class="fnanchor">2935</a>,
the Hæbudes, thirty in number, and, between Hibernia
and Britannia, the islands of Mona<a id="FNanchor_2936" href="#Footnote_2936" class="fnanchor">2936</a>, Monapia<a id="FNanchor_2937" href="#Footnote_2937" class="fnanchor">2937</a>, Ricina<a id="FNanchor_2938" href="#Footnote_2938" class="fnanchor">2938</a>,
Vectis<a id="FNanchor_2939" href="#Footnote_2939" class="fnanchor">2939</a>, Limnus<a id="FNanchor_2940" href="#Footnote_2940" class="fnanchor">2940</a>, and Andros<a id="FNanchor_2941" href="#Footnote_2941" class="fnanchor">2941</a>. Below it are the islands
called Samnis and Axantos<a id="FNanchor_2942" href="#Footnote_2942" class="fnanchor">2942</a>, and opposite, scattered in the
German Sea, are those known as the Glæsariæ<a id="FNanchor_2943" href="#Footnote_2943" class="fnanchor">2943</a>, but which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
the Greeks have more recently called the Electrides, from
the circumstance of their producing <em>electrum</em> or amber.
The most remote of all that we find mentioned is Thule<a id="FNanchor_2944" href="#Footnote_2944" class="fnanchor">2944</a>, in
which, as we have previously stated<a id="FNanchor_2945" href="#Footnote_2945" class="fnanchor">2945</a>, there is no night at the
summer solstice, when the sun is passing through the sign
of Cancer, while on the other hand at the winter solstice
there is no day. Some writers are of opinion that this state
of things lasts for six whole months together. Timæus the
historian says that an island called Mictis<a id="FNanchor_2946" href="#Footnote_2946" class="fnanchor">2946</a> is within six days’
sail of Britannia, in which white lead<a id="FNanchor_2947" href="#Footnote_2947" class="fnanchor">2947</a> is found; and that the
Britons sail over to it in boats of osier<a id="FNanchor_2948" href="#Footnote_2948" class="fnanchor">2948</a>, covered with sewed
hides. There are writers also who make mention of some
other islands, Scandia<a id="FNanchor_2949" href="#Footnote_2949" class="fnanchor">2949</a> namely, Dumna, Bergos, and, greater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
than all, Nerigos, from which persons embark for Thule.
At one day’s sail from Thule is the frozen ocean, which by
some is called the Cronian Sea.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_31">CHAP. 31. (17.)—GALLIA BELGICA.</h3></div>

<p>The whole of Gaul that is comprehended under the one
general name of <em>Comata</em><a id="FNanchor_2950" href="#Footnote_2950" class="fnanchor">2950</a>, is divided into three races of
people, which are more especially kept distinct from each
other by the following rivers. From the Scaldis to the Sequana<a id="FNanchor_2951" href="#Footnote_2951" class="fnanchor">2951</a>
it is Belgic Gaul; from the Sequana to the Garumna<a id="FNanchor_2952" href="#Footnote_2952" class="fnanchor">2952</a>

an immense extent it is here hemmed in by the ocean on the
one side, and by the Iberian Sea on the other. A chain of
the Pyrenees, extending from due east to south-west<a id="FNanchor_3070" href="#Footnote_3070" class="fnanchor">3070</a>, divides
Spain into two parts, the smaller one to the north, the
larger to the south. The first coast that presents itself is
that of the Nearer Spain, otherwise called Tarraconensis.
On leaving the Pyrenees and proceeding along the coast, we

After passing the Cileni, belonging to the jurisdiction of the
Bracari<a id="FNanchor_3101" href="#Footnote_3101" class="fnanchor">3101</a>, we have the Heleni<a id="FNanchor_3102" href="#Footnote_3102" class="fnanchor">3102</a>, the Gravii<a id="FNanchor_3103" href="#Footnote_3103" class="fnanchor">3103</a>, and the fortress

near Numantia, and through the Arevaci and the Vaccæi,
dividing the Vettones from Asturia, the Gallæci from Lusitania,
and separating the Turduli from the Bracari. The
whole of the region here mentioned from the Pyrenees is
full of mines of gold, silver, iron, and lead, both black and

<div class="section">

<p>After passing the Durius, Lusitania<a id="FNanchor_3113" href="#Footnote_3113" class="fnanchor">3113</a> begins. We here have

while many call it the Promontory of Olisipo, from
the city<a id="FNanchor_3122" href="#Footnote_3122" class="fnanchor">3122</a> near it. This spot forms a dividing line in the
land, the sea, and the heavens. Here ends one side<a id="FNanchor_3123" href="#Footnote_3123" class="fnanchor">3123</a> of
Spain; and, when we have doubled the promontory, the
front of Spain begins. (22.) On one side of it lie the North
and the Gallic Ocean, on the other the West and the Atlantic.
The length of this promontory has been estimated by some
persons at sixty miles, by others at ninety. A considerable
number of writers estimate the distance from this spot to
the Pyrenees at 1250 miles; and, committing a manifest
error, place here the nation of the Artabri, a nation
that never<a id="FNanchor_3124" href="#Footnote_3124" class="fnanchor">3124</a> was here. For, making a slight change in the
name, they have placed at this spot the Arrotrebæ, whom
we have previously spoken of as dwelling in front of the
Celtic Promontory.</p>

<p>Mistakes have also been made as to the more celebrated
rivers. From the Minius, which we have previously mentioned,
according to Varro, the river Æminius<a id="FNanchor_3125" href="#Footnote_3125" class="fnanchor">3125</a> is distant
200 miles, which others<a id="FNanchor_3126" href="#Footnote_3126" class="fnanchor">3126</a> suppose to be situate elsewhere,
and called Limæa. By the ancients it was called the “River
of Oblivion,” and it has been made the subject of many
fabulous stories. At a distance of 200 miles from the
Durius is the Tagus, the Munda<a id="FNanchor_3127" href="#Footnote_3127" class="fnanchor">3127</a> lying between them.
The Tagus is famous for its golden sands<a id="FNanchor_3128" href="#Footnote_3128" class="fnanchor">3128</a>. At a distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
of 160 miles from it is the Sacred Promontory<a id="FNanchor_3129" href="#Footnote_3129" class="fnanchor">3129</a>, projecting
from nearly the very middle of the front<a id="FNanchor_3130" href="#Footnote_3130" class="fnanchor">3130</a> of Spain. From
this spot to the middle of the Pyrenees, Varro says, is a
distance of 1400 miles; while to the Anas, by which we
have mentioned<a id="FNanchor_3131" href="#Footnote_3131" class="fnanchor">3131</a> Lusitania as being separated from Bætica,
is 126 miles, it being 102 more to Gades.</p>

<p>The peoples are the Celtici, the Turduli, and, about the
Tagus, the Vettones<a id="FNanchor_3132" href="#Footnote_3132" class="fnanchor">3132</a>. From the river Anas to the Sacred
Promontory<a id="FNanchor_3133" href="#Footnote_3133" class="fnanchor">3133</a> are the Lusitani. The cities worthy of mention
on the coast, beginning from the Tagus, are that of
Olisipo<a id="FNanchor_3134" href="#Footnote_3134" class="fnanchor">3134</a>, famous for its mares, which conceive<a id="FNanchor_3135" href="#Footnote_3135" class="fnanchor">3135</a> from the
west wind; Salacia<a id="FNanchor_3136" href="#Footnote_3136" class="fnanchor">3136</a>, which is surnamed the Imperial
City; Merobrica<a id="FNanchor_3137" href="#Footnote_3137" class="fnanchor">3137</a>; and then the Sacred Promontory, with
the other known by the name of Cuneus<a id="FNanchor_3138" href="#Footnote_3138" class="fnanchor">3138</a>, and the towns of
Ossonoba<a id="FNanchor_3139" href="#Footnote_3139" class="fnanchor">3139</a>, Balsa<a id="FNanchor_3140" href="#Footnote_3140" class="fnanchor">3140</a>, and Myrtili<a id="FNanchor_3141" href="#Footnote_3141" class="fnanchor">3141</a>.</p>

<p>The whole of this province is divided into three jurisdictions,
those of Emerita, Pax, and Scalabis. It contains in
all forty-six peoples, among whom there are five colonies,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
one municipal town of Roman citizens, three with the
ancient Latin rights, and thirty-six that are tributaries.
The colonies are those of Augusta Emerita<a id="FNanchor_3142" href="#Footnote_3142" class="fnanchor">3142</a>, situate on the
river Anas, Metallinum<a id="FNanchor_3143" href="#Footnote_3143" class="fnanchor">3143</a>, Pax<a id="FNanchor_3144" href="#Footnote_3144" class="fnanchor">3144</a>, and Norba<a id="FNanchor_3145" href="#Footnote_3145" class="fnanchor">3145</a>, surnamed Cæsariana.
To this last place of jurisdiction the people of
Castra Servilia<a id="FNanchor_3146" href="#Footnote_3146" class="fnanchor">3146</a> and Castra Cæcilia<a id="FNanchor_3147" href="#Footnote_3147" class="fnanchor">3147</a> resort. The fifth jurisdiction
is that of Scalabis<a id="FNanchor_3148" href="#Footnote_3148" class="fnanchor">3148</a>, which also has the name of
Præsidium Julium<a id="FNanchor_3149" href="#Footnote_3149" class="fnanchor">3149</a>. Olisipo, surnamed Felicitas Julia<a id="FNanchor_3150" href="#Footnote_3150" class="fnanchor">3150</a>, is a
municipal city, whose inhabitants enjoy the rights of Roman
citizens. The towns in the enjoyment of the ancient Latin
rights are Ebora<a id="FNanchor_3151" href="#Footnote_3151" class="fnanchor">3151</a>, which also has the name of Liberalitas
Julia<a id="FNanchor_3152" href="#Footnote_3152" class="fnanchor">3152</a>, and Myrtili and Salacia, which we have previously
mentioned. Those among the tributaries whom it
may not be amiss to mention, in addition to those already<a id="FNanchor_3153" href="#Footnote_3153" class="fnanchor">3153</a>
alluded to among the names of those in Bætica, are the
Augustobrigenses<a id="FNanchor_3154" href="#Footnote_3154" class="fnanchor">3154</a>, the Ammienses<a id="FNanchor_3155" href="#Footnote_3155" class="fnanchor">3155</a>, the Aranditani, the
Arabricenses, the Balsenses, the Cæsarobricenses, the Caperenses<a id="FNanchor_3156" href="#Footnote_3156" class="fnanchor">3156</a>,
the Caurenses<a id="FNanchor_3157" href="#Footnote_3157" class="fnanchor">3157</a>, the Colarni, the Cibilitani, the
Concordienses<a id="FNanchor_3158" href="#Footnote_3158" class="fnanchor">3158</a>, the Elbocorii, the Interannienses, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Lancienses<a id="FNanchor_3159" href="#Footnote_3159" class="fnanchor">3159</a>, the Mirobrigenses, surnamed<a id="FNanchor_3160" href="#Footnote_3160" class="fnanchor">3160</a> Celtici, the Medubrigenses<a id="FNanchor_3161" href="#Footnote_3161" class="fnanchor">3161</a>,
surnamed Plumbarii, the Ocelenses<a id="FNanchor_3162" href="#Footnote_3162" class="fnanchor">3162</a> or Lancienses,
the Turduli, also called Barduli, and the Tapori.
Agrippa states, that Lusitania, with Asturia and Gallæcia,
is 540 miles in length, and 536 in breadth. The provinces
of Spain, measured from the two extreme<a id="FNanchor_3163" href="#Footnote_3163" class="fnanchor">3163</a> promontories
of the Pyrenees, along the sea-line of the entire coast, are
thought to be 3922 miles in circumference; while some
writers make them to be but 2600.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_36">CHAP. 36.—THE ISLANDS IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN.</h3></div>

<p>Opposite to Celtiberia are a number of islands, by the
Greeks called Cassiterides<a id="FNanchor_3164" href="#Footnote_3164" class="fnanchor">3164</a>, in consequence of their abounding
in tin: and, facing the Promontory<a id="FNanchor_3165" href="#Footnote_3165" class="fnanchor">3165</a> of the Arrotrebæ, are
the six Islands of the Gods, which some persons have
called the Fortunate Islands<a id="FNanchor_3166" href="#Footnote_3166" class="fnanchor">3166</a>. At the very commencement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
of Bætica, and twenty-five miles from the mouth of the
Straits of Gades, is the island of Gadis, twelve miles long
and three broad, as Polybius states in his writings. At its
nearest part, it is less than 700 feet<a id="FNanchor_3167" href="#Footnote_3167" class="fnanchor">3167</a> distant from the mainland,
while in the remaining portion it is distant more than
seven miles. Its circuit is fifteen miles, and it has on it a
city which enjoys the rights of Roman citizens<a id="FNanchor_3168" href="#Footnote_3168" class="fnanchor">3168</a>, and whose
people are called the Augustani of the city of Julia
Gaditana. On the side which looks towards Spain, at about
100 paces distance, is another long island, three miles wide,
on which the original city of Gades stood. By Ephorus and
Philistides it is called Erythia, by Timæus and Silenus Aphrodisias<a id="FNanchor_3169" href="#Footnote_3169" class="fnanchor">3169</a>,
and by the natives the Isle of Juno. Timæus says,
that the larger island used to be called Cotinusa<a id="FNanchor_3170" href="#Footnote_3170" class="fnanchor">3170</a>, from its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
olives; the Romans call it Tartessos<a id="FNanchor_3171" href="#Footnote_3171" class="fnanchor">3171</a>; the Carthaginians
Gadir<a id="FNanchor_3172" href="#Footnote_3172" class="fnanchor">3172</a>, that word in the Punic language signifying a hedge.
It was called Erythia because the Tyrians, the original ancestors
of the Carthaginians, were said to have come from
the Erythræan, or Red Sea. In this island Geryon is by
some thought to have dwelt, whose herds were carried off
by Hercules. Other persons again think, that his island
is another one, opposite to Lusitania, and that it was there
formerly called by that name<a id="FNanchor_3173" href="#Footnote_3173" class="fnanchor">3173</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_IV_CHAP_37">CHAP. 37. (23.)—THE GENERAL MEASUREMENT OF EUROPE.</h3></div>

<p>Having thus made the circuit of Europe, we must now
give the complete measurement of it, in order that those
who wish to be acquainted with this subject may not feel
themselves at a loss. Artemidorus and Isidorus have given
its length, from the Tanais to Gades, as 8214 miles. Polybius
in his writings has stated the breadth of Europe, in a
line from Italy to the ocean, to be 1150 miles. But, even
in his day, its magnitude was but little known. The distance
of Italy, as we have previously<a id="FNanchor_3174" href="#Footnote_3174" class="fnanchor">3174</a> stated, as for as the Alps, is
1120 miles, from which, through Lugdunum to the British
port of the Morini<a id="FNanchor_3175" href="#Footnote_3175" class="fnanchor">3175</a>, the direction which Polybius seems to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
follow, is 1168 miles. But the better ascertained, though
greater length, is that taken from the Alps through the
Camp of the Legions<a id="FNanchor_3176" href="#Footnote_3176" class="fnanchor">3176</a> in Germany, in a north-westerly
direction, to the mouth of the Rhine, being 1543 miles.
We shall now have to speak of Africa and Asia.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_1">CHAP. 1.—THE TWO MAURITANIAS.</h3></div>

<p>The Greeks have given the name of Libya<a id="FNanchor_3232" href="#Footnote_3232" class="fnanchor">3232</a> to Africa, and
have called the sea that lies in front of it the Libyan Sea.
It has Egypt for its boundary, and no part of the earth is
there that has fewer gulfs or inlets, its shores extending in a
lengthened line from the west in an oblique direction. The
names of its peoples, and its cities in especial, cannot possibly
be pronounced with correctness, except by the aid of
their own native tongues. Its population, too, for the most
part dwells only in fortresses<a id="FNanchor_3233" href="#Footnote_3233" class="fnanchor">3233</a>.</p>

<p>(1.) On our entrance into Africa, we find the two Mauritanias,
which, until the time of Caius Cæsar<a id="FNanchor_3234" href="#Footnote_3234" class="fnanchor">3234</a>, the son
of Germanicus, were kingdoms; but, suffering under his
cruelty, they were divided into two provinces. The extreme
promontory of Africa, which projects into the ocean, is called
Ampelusia<a id="FNanchor_3235" href="#Footnote_3235" class="fnanchor">3235</a> by the Greeks. There were formerly two towns,
Lissa and Cotte<a id="FNanchor_3236" href="#Footnote_3236" class="fnanchor">3236</a>, beyond the Pillars of Hercules; but, at
the present day, we only find that of Tingi<a id="FNanchor_3237" href="#Footnote_3237" class="fnanchor">3237</a>, which was formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
founded by Antæus, and afterwards received the name
of Traducta Julia<a id="FNanchor_3238" href="#Footnote_3238" class="fnanchor">3238</a>, from Claudius Cæsar, when he established
a colony there. It is thirty miles distant from
Belon<a id="FNanchor_3239" href="#Footnote_3239" class="fnanchor">3239</a>, a town of Bætica, where the passage across is the
shortest. At a distance of twenty-five miles from Tingi,
upon the shores of the ocean<a id="FNanchor_3240" href="#Footnote_3240" class="fnanchor">3240</a>, we come to Julia Constantia
Zilis<a id="FNanchor_3241" href="#Footnote_3241" class="fnanchor">3241</a>, a colony of Augustus. This place is exempt
from all subjection to the kings of Mauritania, and is included
in the legal jurisdiction of Bætica. Thirty-two
miles distant from Julia Constantia is Lixos<a id="FNanchor_3242" href="#Footnote_3242" class="fnanchor">3242</a>, which was
made a Roman colony by Claudius Cæsar, and which has
been the subject of such wondrous fables, related by the
writers of antiquity. At this place, according to the
story, was the palace of Antæus; this was the scene of his
combat with Hercules, and here were the gardens of the
Hesperides<a id="FNanchor_3243" href="#Footnote_3243" class="fnanchor">3243</a>. An arm of the sea flows into the land here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
with a serpentine channel, and, from the nature of the
locality, this is interpreted at the present day as having been
what was really represented by the story of the dragon
keeping guard there. This tract of water surrounds an
island, the only spot which is never overflowed by the tides
of the sea, although not quite so elevated as the rest of the
land in its vicinity. Upon this island, also, there is still in
existence the altar of Hercules; but of the grove that bore
the golden fruit, there are no traces left, beyond some wild
olive-trees. People will certainly be the less surprised at
the marvellous falsehoods of the Greeks, which have been
related about this place and the river Lixos<a id="FNanchor_3244" href="#Footnote_3244" class="fnanchor">3244</a>, when they reflect
that some of our own<a id="FNanchor_3245" href="#Footnote_3245" class="fnanchor">3245</a> countrymen as well, and that
too very recently, have related stories in reference to them
hardly less monstrous; how that this city is remarkable for
its power and extensive influence, and how that it is even
greater than Great Carthage ever was; how, too, that it is
situate just opposite to Carthage, and at an almost immeasurable
distance from Tingi, together with other details
of a similar nature, all of which Cornelius Nepos has believed
with the most insatiate credulity<a id="FNanchor_3246" href="#Footnote_3246" class="fnanchor">3246</a>.</p>

<p>In the interior, at a distance of forty miles from Lixos, is
Babba<a id="FNanchor_3247" href="#Footnote_3247" class="fnanchor">3247</a>, surnamed Julia Campestris, another colony of Augustus;
and, at a distance of seventy-five, a third, called Banasa<a id="FNanchor_3248" href="#Footnote_3248" class="fnanchor">3248</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
with the surname of Valentia. At a distance of thirty-five
miles from this last is the town of Volubilis, which is just
that distance also from both<a id="FNanchor_3249" href="#Footnote_3249" class="fnanchor">3249</a> seas. On the coast, at a
distance of fifty miles from Lixos, is the river Subur<a id="FNanchor_3250" href="#Footnote_3250" class="fnanchor">3250</a>, which
flows past the colony of Banasa, a fine river, and available
for the purposes of navigation. At the same distance from
it is the city of Sala<a id="FNanchor_3251" href="#Footnote_3251" class="fnanchor">3251</a>, situate on a river which bears the
same name, a place which stands upon the very verge of the
desert, and though infested by troops of elephants, is much
more exposed to the attacks of the nation of the Autololes,
through whose country lies the road to Mount Atlas, the
most fabulous<a id="FNanchor_3252" href="#Footnote_3252" class="fnanchor">3252</a> locality even in Africa.</p>

<p>It is from the midst of the sands, according to the story,
that this mountain<a id="FNanchor_3253" href="#Footnote_3253" class="fnanchor">3253</a> raises its head to the heavens; rugged
and craggy on the side which looks toward the shores of the
ocean to which it has given its name, while on that which
faces the interior of Africa it is shaded by dense groves
of trees, and refreshed by flowing streams; fruits of all
kinds springing up there spontaneously to such an extent,
as to more than satiate every possible desire. Throughout
the daytime, no inhabitant is to be seen; all is silent, like
that dreadful stillness which reigns in the desert. A religious
horror steals imperceptibly over the feelings of those who
approach, and they feel themselves smitten with awe at the
stupendous aspect of its summit, which reaches beyond the
clouds, and well nigh approaches the very orb of the moon.
At night, they say, it gleams with fires innumerable lighted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
up; it is then the scene of the gambols of the Ægipans<a id="FNanchor_3254" href="#Footnote_3254" class="fnanchor">3254</a> and
the Satyr crew, while it re-echoes with the notes of the flute
and the pipe, and the clash of drums and cymbals. All this
is what authors of high character have stated, in addition to
the labours which Hercules and Perseus there experienced.
The space which intervenes before you arrive at this mountain
is immense, and the country quite unknown.</p>

<p>There formerly existed some Commentaries written by
Hanno<a id="FNanchor_3255" href="#Footnote_3255" class="fnanchor">3255</a>, a Carthaginian general, who was commanded, in
the most flourishing times of the Punic state, to explore
the sea-coast of Africa. The greater part of the Greek
and Roman writers have followed him, and have related,
among other fabulous stories, that many cities there were
founded by him, of which no remembrance, nor yet the
slightest vestige, now exists.</p>

<p>While Scipio Æmilianus held the command in Sicily,
Polybius the historian received a fleet from him for the
purpose of proceeding on a voyage of discovery in this part
of the world. He relates, that beyond<a id="FNanchor_3256" href="#Footnote_3256" class="fnanchor">3256</a> Mount Atlas, proceeding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
in a westerly direction, there are forests filled with
wild beasts, peculiar to the soil of Africa, as far as the
river Anatis<a id="FNanchor_3257" href="#Footnote_3257" class="fnanchor">3257</a>, a distance of 485 miles, Lixos being distant
from it 205 miles. Agrippa says, that Lixos is distant from
the Straits of Gades 112 miles. After it we come to a
gulf which is called the Gulf of Saguti<a id="FNanchor_3258" href="#Footnote_3258" class="fnanchor">3258</a>, a town situate on
the Promontory of Mulelacha<a id="FNanchor_3259" href="#Footnote_3259" class="fnanchor">3259</a>, the rivers Subur and Salat<a id="FNanchor_3260" href="#Footnote_3260" class="fnanchor">3260</a>,
and the port of Rutubis<a id="FNanchor_3261" href="#Footnote_3261" class="fnanchor">3261</a>, distant from Lixos 213 miles.
We then come to the Promontory of the Sun<a id="FNanchor_3262" href="#Footnote_3262" class="fnanchor">3262</a>, the port of
Risardir<a id="FNanchor_3263" href="#Footnote_3263" class="fnanchor">3263</a>, the Gætulian Autololes, the river Cosenus<a id="FNanchor_3264" href="#Footnote_3264" class="fnanchor">3264</a>, the
nations of the Selatiti and the Masati, the river Masathat<a id="FNanchor_3265" href="#Footnote_3265" class="fnanchor">3265</a>,
and the river Darat<a id="FNanchor_3266" href="#Footnote_3266" class="fnanchor">3266</a>, in which crocodiles are found. After
this we come to a large gulf, 616<a id="FNanchor_3267" href="#Footnote_3267" class="fnanchor">3267</a> miles in extent, which is
enclosed by a promontory of Mount Barce<a id="FNanchor_3268" href="#Footnote_3268" class="fnanchor">3268</a>, which runs
out in a westerly direction, and is called Surrentium<a id="FNanchor_3269" href="#Footnote_3269" class="fnanchor">3269</a>.
Next comes the river Salsus<a id="FNanchor_3270" href="#Footnote_3270" class="fnanchor">3270</a>, beyond which lie the Æthiopian
Perorsi, at the back of whom are the Pharusii<a id="FNanchor_3271" href="#Footnote_3271" class="fnanchor">3271</a>, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
are bordered upon by the Gætulian Daræ<a id="FNanchor_3272" href="#Footnote_3272" class="fnanchor">3272</a>, lying in the
interior. Upon the coast again, we find the Æthiopian
Daratitæ, and the river Bambotus<a id="FNanchor_3273" href="#Footnote_3273" class="fnanchor">3273</a>, teeming with crocodiles
and hippopotami. From this river there is a continuous
range<a id="FNanchor_3274" href="#Footnote_3274" class="fnanchor">3274</a> of mountains till we come to the one which
is known by the name of Theon Ochema<a id="FNanchor_3275" href="#Footnote_3275" class="fnanchor">3275</a>, from which to the
Hesperian Promontory<a id="FNanchor_3276" href="#Footnote_3276" class="fnanchor">3276</a> is a voyage of ten days and nights;
and in the middle of this space he<a id="FNanchor_3277" href="#Footnote_3277" class="fnanchor">3277</a> has placed Mount Atlas,
which by all other writers has been stated to be in the extreme
parts of Mauritania.</p>

<p>The Roman arms, for the first time, pursued their conquests
into Mauritania, under the Emperor Claudius, when
the freedman Ædemon took up arms to avenge the death of
King Ptolemy<a id="FNanchor_3278" href="#Footnote_3278" class="fnanchor">3278</a>, who had been put to death by Caius Cæsar;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
and it is a well-known fact, that on the flight of the barbarians
our troops reached Mount Atlas. It became a boast,
not only among men of consular rank, and generals selected
from the senate, who at that time held the command, but
among persons of equestrian rank as well, who after that
period held the government there, that they had penetrated as
far as Mount Atlas. There are, as we have already stated, five
Roman colonies in this province; and it may very possibly appear,
if we listen only to what report says, that this mountain
is easily accessible. Upon trial, however, it has been pretty
generally shown, that all such statements are utterly fallacious;
and it is too true, that men in high station, when
they are disinclined to take the trouble of inquiring into
the truth, through a feeling of shame at their ignorance are
not averse to be guilty of falsehood; and never is implicit
credence more readily given, than when a falsehood is supported
by the authority of some personage of high consideration.
For my own part, I am far less surprised that there are
still some facts remaining undiscovered by men of the equestrian
order, and even those among them who have attained
senatorial rank, than that the love of luxury has left anything
unascertained; the impulse of which must be great
indeed, and most powerfully felt, when the very forests are
ransacked for their ivory and citron-wood<a id="FNanchor_3279" href="#Footnote_3279" class="fnanchor">3279</a>, and all the rocks
of Gætulia are searched for the murex and the purple.</p>

<p>From the natives, however, we learn, that on the coast, at
a distance of 150 miles from the Salat, the river Asana<a id="FNanchor_3280" href="#Footnote_3280" class="fnanchor">3280</a> presents
itself; its waters are salt, but it is remarkable for its
fine harbour. They also say that after this we come to a
river known by the name of Fut<a id="FNanchor_3281" href="#Footnote_3281" class="fnanchor">3281</a>, and then, after crossing
another called Vior which lies on the road, at a distance of
200 miles we arrive at Dyris<a id="FNanchor_3282" href="#Footnote_3282" class="fnanchor">3282</a>, such being the name which in
their language they give to Mount Atlas. According to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
story there are still existing in its vicinity many vestiges which
tend to prove that the locality was once inhabited; such as
the remains of vineyards and plantations of palm-trees.</p>

<p>Suetonius Paulinus<a id="FNanchor_3283" href="#Footnote_3283" class="fnanchor">3283</a>, whom we have seen Consul in our
own time, was the first Roman general who advanced a
distance of some miles beyond Mount Atlas. He has given
us the same information as we have received from other
sources with reference to the extraordinary height of this
mountain, and at the same time he has stated that all the
lower parts about the foot of it are covered with dense
and lofty forests composed of trees of species hitherto unknown.
The height of these trees, he says, is remarkable;
the trunks are without knots, and of a smooth and glossy
surface; the foliage is like that of the cypress, and besides
sending forth a powerful odour, they are covered with a
flossy down, from which, by the aid of art, a fine cloth might
easily be manufactured, similar to the textures made from the
produce of the silk-worm. He informs us that the summit
of this mountain is covered with snow even in summer, and
says that having arrived there after a march of ten days, he
proceeded some distance beyond it as far as a river which
bears the name of Ger<a id="FNanchor_3284" href="#Footnote_3284" class="fnanchor">3284</a>; the road being through deserts
covered with a black sand<a id="FNanchor_3285" href="#Footnote_3285" class="fnanchor">3285</a>, from which rocks that bore the
appearance of having been exposed to the action of fire, projected
every here and there; localities rendered quite uninhabitable
by the intensity of the heat, as he himself experienced,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
although it was in the winter season that he visited them.
We also learn from the same source that the people who
inhabit the adjoining forests, which are full of all kinds of
elephants, wild beasts, and serpents, have the name of Canarii;
from the circumstance that they partake of their food
in common with the canine race, and share with it the
entrails of wild beasts.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact, that adjoining to these localities
is a nation of Æthiopians, which bears the name of Perorsi.
Juba, the father of Ptolemy, who was the first king<a id="FNanchor_3286" href="#Footnote_3286" class="fnanchor">3286</a> who
reigned over both the Mauritanias, and who has been rendered
even more famous by the brilliancy of his learning than by
his kingly rank, has given us similar information relative to
Mount Atlas, and states that a certain herb grows there,
which has received the name of ‘euphorbia’<a id="FNanchor_3287" href="#Footnote_3287" class="fnanchor">3287</a> from that of his
physician, who was the first to discover it. Juba extols with
wondrous praises the milky juice of this plant as tending to
improve the sight, and acting as a specific against the bites
of serpents and all kinds of poison; and to this subject alone
he has devoted an entire book. Thus much, if indeed not
more than enough, about Mount Atlas.</p>

<p>(2.) The province of Tingitana is 170 miles in length<a id="FNanchor_3288" href="#Footnote_3288" class="fnanchor">3288</a>.
Of the nations in this province the principal one was formerly
that of the Mauri<a id="FNanchor_3289" href="#Footnote_3289" class="fnanchor">3289</a>, who have given to it the name of
Mauritania, and have been by many writers called the
Maurusii<a id="FNanchor_3290" href="#Footnote_3290" class="fnanchor">3290</a>. This nation has been greatly weakened by the
disasters of war, and is now dwindled down to a few families
only<a id="FNanchor_3291" href="#Footnote_3291" class="fnanchor">3291</a>. Next to the Mauri was formerly the nation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
the Massæsyli<a id="FNanchor_3292" href="#Footnote_3292" class="fnanchor">3292</a>; they in a similar manner have become extinct.
Their country is now occupied by the Gætulian nations<a id="FNanchor_3293" href="#Footnote_3293" class="fnanchor">3293</a>,
the Baniuræ<a id="FNanchor_3294" href="#Footnote_3294" class="fnanchor">3294</a>, the Autololes<a id="FNanchor_3295" href="#Footnote_3295" class="fnanchor">3295</a>, by far the most powerful
people among them all, and the Vesuni, who formerly
were a part of the Autololes, but have now separated from
them, and, turning their steps towards the Æthiopians<a id="FNanchor_3296" href="#Footnote_3296" class="fnanchor">3296</a>,
have formed a distinct nation of their own. This province,
in the mountainous district which lies on its eastern side,
produces elephants, as also on the heights of Mount Abyla<a id="FNanchor_3297" href="#Footnote_3297" class="fnanchor">3297</a>
and among those elevations which, from the similarity of
their height, are called the Seven Brothers<a id="FNanchor_3298" href="#Footnote_3298" class="fnanchor">3298</a>. Joining the
range of Abyla these mountains overlook the Straits of Gades.
At the extremity of this chain begin the shores of the inland
sea<a id="FNanchor_3299" href="#Footnote_3299" class="fnanchor">3299</a>, and we come to the Tamuda<a id="FNanchor_3300" href="#Footnote_3300" class="fnanchor">3300</a>, a navigable stream,
with the site of a former town of the same name, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
the river Laud<a id="FNanchor_3301" href="#Footnote_3301" class="fnanchor">3301</a>, which is also navigable for vessels, the town
and port of Rhysaddir<a id="FNanchor_3302" href="#Footnote_3302" class="fnanchor">3302</a>, and Malvane<a id="FNanchor_3303" href="#Footnote_3303" class="fnanchor">3303</a>, a navigable stream.</p>

<p>The city of Siga<a id="FNanchor_3304" href="#Footnote_3304" class="fnanchor">3304</a>, formerly the residence of King Syphax, lies
opposite to that of Malaca<a id="FNanchor_3305" href="#Footnote_3305" class="fnanchor">3305</a> in Spain: it now belongs to the
second<a id="FNanchor_3306" href="#Footnote_3306" class="fnanchor">3306</a> Mauritania. But these countries, I should remark,
for a long time retained the names of their respective kings,
the further Mauritania being called the “land of Bogud<a id="FNanchor_3307" href="#Footnote_3307" class="fnanchor">3307</a>,”
while that which is now called Cæsariensis was called the
“country of Bocchus.” After passing Siga we come to the
haven called “Portus Magnus<a id="FNanchor_3308" href="#Footnote_3308" class="fnanchor">3308</a>” from its great extent, with a
town whose people enjoy the rights of Roman citizens, and
then the river Mulucha<a id="FNanchor_3309" href="#Footnote_3309" class="fnanchor">3309</a>, which served as the limit between
the territory of Bocchus and that of the Massæsyli. Next
to this is Quiza Xenitana<a id="FNanchor_3310" href="#Footnote_3310" class="fnanchor">3310</a>, a town founded by strangers,
and Arsenaria<a id="FNanchor_3311" href="#Footnote_3311" class="fnanchor">3311</a>, a place with the ancient Latin rights, three
miles distant from the sea. We then come to Cartenna<a id="FNanchor_3312" href="#Footnote_3312" class="fnanchor">3312</a>, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
colony founded under Augustus by the second legion, and
Gunugum<a id="FNanchor_3313" href="#Footnote_3313" class="fnanchor">3313</a>, another colony founded by the same emperor, a
prætorian cohort being established there; the Promontory
of Apollo<a id="FNanchor_3314" href="#Footnote_3314" class="fnanchor">3314</a>, and a most celebrated city, now called
Cæsarea<a id="FNanchor_3315" href="#Footnote_3315" class="fnanchor">3315</a>, but formerly known by the name of Iol; this
place was the residence of King Juba, and received the
rights of a colony from the now deified Emperor Claudius.
Oppidum Novum<a id="FNanchor_3316" href="#Footnote_3316" class="fnanchor">3316</a> is the next place; a colony of veterans
was established here by command of the same emperor.
Next to it is Tipasa<a id="FNanchor_3317" href="#Footnote_3317" class="fnanchor">3317</a>, which has received Latin rights, as
also Icasium<a id="FNanchor_3318" href="#Footnote_3318" class="fnanchor">3318</a>, which has been presented by the Emperor
Vespasianus with similar rights; Rusconiæ<a id="FNanchor_3319" href="#Footnote_3319" class="fnanchor">3319</a>, a colony
founded by Augustus; Rusucurium<a id="FNanchor_3320" href="#Footnote_3320" class="fnanchor">3320</a>, honoured by Claudius
with the rights of Roman citizens; Ruzacus<a id="FNanchor_3321" href="#Footnote_3321" class="fnanchor">3321</a>, a colony
founded by Augustus; Salde<a id="FNanchor_3322" href="#Footnote_3322" class="fnanchor">3322</a>, another colony founded
by the same emperor; Igilgili<a id="FNanchor_3323" href="#Footnote_3323" class="fnanchor">3323</a>, another; and the town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
Tucca<a id="FNanchor_3324" href="#Footnote_3324" class="fnanchor">3324</a>, situate on the sea-shore and upon the river Ampsaga.
In the interior are the colony of Augusta, also called
Succabar<a id="FNanchor_3325" href="#Footnote_3325" class="fnanchor">3325</a>, Tubusuptus<a id="FNanchor_3326" href="#Footnote_3326" class="fnanchor">3326</a>, the cities of Timici and Tigavæ<a id="FNanchor_3327" href="#Footnote_3327" class="fnanchor">3327</a>,
the rivers Sardabal<a id="FNanchor_3328" href="#Footnote_3328" class="fnanchor">3328</a>, Aves<a id="FNanchor_3329" href="#Footnote_3329" class="fnanchor">3329</a>, and Nabar<a id="FNanchor_3330" href="#Footnote_3330" class="fnanchor">3330</a>, the nation of the
Macurebi, the river Usar<a id="FNanchor_3331" href="#Footnote_3331" class="fnanchor">3331</a>, and the nation of the Nababes.
The river Ampsaga is distant from Cæsarea 322<a id="FNanchor_3332" href="#Footnote_3332" class="fnanchor">3332</a> miles. The
length of the two Mauritanias is 1038, and their breadth
467 miles.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_2">CHAP. 2. (3.)—NUMIDIA.</h3></div>

<p>At the river Ampsaga Numidia begins, a country rendered
illustrious by the fame of Masinissa. By the Greeks this
region was called Metagonitis<a id="FNanchor_3333" href="#Footnote_3333" class="fnanchor">3333</a>; and the Numidians received
the name of “Nomades” from their frequent changes of pasturage;
upon which occasions they were accustomed to carry<a id="FNanchor_3334" href="#Footnote_3334" class="fnanchor">3334</a>
their <em>mapalia</em>, or in other words, their houses, upon waggons.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
The towns of this country are Cullu<a id="FNanchor_3335" href="#Footnote_3335" class="fnanchor">3335</a> and Rusicade<a id="FNanchor_3336" href="#Footnote_3336" class="fnanchor">3336</a>; and
at a distance of forty-eight miles from the latter, in the interior,
is the colony of Cirta<a id="FNanchor_3337" href="#Footnote_3337" class="fnanchor">3337</a>, surnamed “of the Sitiani;”
still more inland is another colony called Sicca<a id="FNanchor_3338" href="#Footnote_3338" class="fnanchor">3338</a>, with
the free town of Bulla Regia<a id="FNanchor_3339" href="#Footnote_3339" class="fnanchor">3339</a>. On the coast are Tacatua<a id="FNanchor_3340" href="#Footnote_3340" class="fnanchor">3340</a>,
Hippo Regius<a id="FNanchor_3341" href="#Footnote_3341" class="fnanchor">3341</a>, the river Armua<a id="FNanchor_3342" href="#Footnote_3342" class="fnanchor">3342</a>, and the town of Tabraca<a id="FNanchor_3343" href="#Footnote_3343" class="fnanchor">3343</a>,
with the rights of Roman citizens. The river Tusca<a id="FNanchor_3344" href="#Footnote_3344" class="fnanchor">3344</a> forms
the boundary of Numidia. This country produces nothing
remarkable except its marble<a id="FNanchor_3345" href="#Footnote_3345" class="fnanchor">3345</a> and wild beasts.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_3">CHAP. 3. (4.)—AFRICA.</h3></div>

<p>Beyond the river Tusca begins the region of Zeugitana<a id="FNanchor_3346" href="#Footnote_3346" class="fnanchor">3346</a>,
and that part which properly bears the name of Africa<a id="FNanchor_3347" href="#Footnote_3347" class="fnanchor">3347</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
We here find three promontories; the White Promontory<a id="FNanchor_3348" href="#Footnote_3348" class="fnanchor">3348</a>,
the Promontory of Apollo<a id="FNanchor_3349" href="#Footnote_3349" class="fnanchor">3349</a>, facing Sardinia, and that of
Mercury<a id="FNanchor_3350" href="#Footnote_3350" class="fnanchor">3350</a>, opposite to Sicily. Projecting into the sea these
headlands form two gulfs, the first of which bears the name
of “Hipponensis” from its proximity to the city called
Hippo Dirutus<a id="FNanchor_3351" href="#Footnote_3351" class="fnanchor">3351</a>, a corruption of the Greek name Diarrhytus,
which it has received from the channels made for irrigation.
Adjacent to this place, but at a greater distance from
the sea-shore, is Theudalis<a id="FNanchor_3352" href="#Footnote_3352" class="fnanchor">3352</a>, a town exempt from tribute.
We then come to the Promontory of Apollo, and upon
the second gulf, we find Utica<a id="FNanchor_3353" href="#Footnote_3353" class="fnanchor">3353</a>, a place enjoying the rights
of Roman citizens, and famous for the death of Cato; the
river Bagrada<a id="FNanchor_3354" href="#Footnote_3354" class="fnanchor">3354</a>, the place called Castra Cornelia<a id="FNanchor_3355" href="#Footnote_3355" class="fnanchor">3355</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
colony<a id="FNanchor_3356" href="#Footnote_3356" class="fnanchor">3356</a> of Carthage, founded upon the remains of Great Carthage<a id="FNanchor_3357" href="#Footnote_3357" class="fnanchor">3357</a>,
the colony of Maxula<a id="FNanchor_3358" href="#Footnote_3358" class="fnanchor">3358</a>, the towns of Carpi<a id="FNanchor_3359" href="#Footnote_3359" class="fnanchor">3359</a>, Misua,
and Clypea<a id="FNanchor_3360" href="#Footnote_3360" class="fnanchor">3360</a>, the last a free town, on the Promontory of
Mercury; also Curubis, a free town<a id="FNanchor_3361" href="#Footnote_3361" class="fnanchor">3361</a>, and Neapolis<a id="FNanchor_3362" href="#Footnote_3362" class="fnanchor">3362</a>.</p>

<p>Here commences the second division<a id="FNanchor_3363" href="#Footnote_3363" class="fnanchor">3363</a> of Africa properly
so called. Those who inhabit Byzacium have the name of
Libyphœnices<a id="FNanchor_3364" href="#Footnote_3364" class="fnanchor">3364</a>. Byzacium is the name of a district which
is 250 miles in circumference, and is remarkable for its extreme
fertility, as the ground returns the seed sown by the
husbandman with interest a hundred-fold<a id="FNanchor_3365" href="#Footnote_3365" class="fnanchor">3365</a>. Here are the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
free towns of Leptis<a id="FNanchor_3366" href="#Footnote_3366" class="fnanchor">3366</a>, Adrumetum<a id="FNanchor_3367" href="#Footnote_3367" class="fnanchor">3367</a>, Ruspina<a id="FNanchor_3368" href="#Footnote_3368" class="fnanchor">3368</a>, and Thapsus<a id="FNanchor_3369" href="#Footnote_3369" class="fnanchor">3369</a>;
and then Thenæ<a id="FNanchor_3370" href="#Footnote_3370" class="fnanchor">3370</a>, Macomades<a id="FNanchor_3371" href="#Footnote_3371" class="fnanchor">3371</a>, Tacape<a id="FNanchor_3372" href="#Footnote_3372" class="fnanchor">3372</a>, and Sabrata<a id="FNanchor_3373" href="#Footnote_3373" class="fnanchor">3373</a> which
touches on the Lesser Syrtis; to which spot, from the
Ampsaga, the length of Numidia and Africa is 580 miles,
and the breadth, so far as it has been ascertained, 200.
That portion which we have called Africa is divided into
two provinces, the Old and the New; these are separated
by a dyke which was made by order of the second Scipio
Africanus<a id="FNanchor_3374" href="#Footnote_3374" class="fnanchor">3374</a> and the kings<a id="FNanchor_3375" href="#Footnote_3375" class="fnanchor">3375</a>, and extended to Thenæ, which
town is distant from Carthage 216 miles.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_4">CHAP. 4.—THE SYRTES.</h3></div>

<p>A third Gulf is divided into two smaller ones, those of
the two Syrtes<a id="FNanchor_3376" href="#Footnote_3376" class="fnanchor">3376</a>, which are rendered perilous by the shallows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
of their quicksands and the ebb and flow of the sea. Polybius
states the distance from Carthage to the Lesser Syrtis,
the one which is nearest to it, to be 300 miles. The inlet
to it he also states to be 100 miles across, and its circumference
300. There is also a way<a id="FNanchor_3377" href="#Footnote_3377" class="fnanchor">3377</a> to it by land, to find
which we must employ the guidance of the stars and cross
deserts which present nothing but sand and serpents. After
passing these we come to forests filled with vast multitudes
of wild beasts and elephants, then desert wastes<a id="FNanchor_3378" href="#Footnote_3378" class="fnanchor">3378</a>, and beyond
them the Garamantes<a id="FNanchor_3379" href="#Footnote_3379" class="fnanchor">3379</a>, distant twelve days’ journey from
the Augylæ<a id="FNanchor_3380" href="#Footnote_3380" class="fnanchor">3380</a>. Above the Garamantes was formerly the nation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
of the Psylli<a id="FNanchor_3381" href="#Footnote_3381" class="fnanchor">3381</a>, and above them again the Lake of Lycomedes<a id="FNanchor_3382" href="#Footnote_3382" class="fnanchor">3382</a>,
surrounded with deserts. The Augylæ themselves
are situate almost midway between Æthiopia which faces
the west<a id="FNanchor_3383" href="#Footnote_3383" class="fnanchor">3383</a>, and the region which lies between<a id="FNanchor_3384" href="#Footnote_3384" class="fnanchor">3384</a> the two Syrtes,
at an equal distance from both. The distance along the
coast that lies between the two Syrtes is 250 miles. On it
are found the city of Œa<a id="FNanchor_3385" href="#Footnote_3385" class="fnanchor">3385</a>, the river Cinyps<a id="FNanchor_3386" href="#Footnote_3386" class="fnanchor">3386</a>, and the country
of that name, the towns of Neapolis<a id="FNanchor_3387" href="#Footnote_3387" class="fnanchor">3387</a>, Graphara<a id="FNanchor_3388" href="#Footnote_3388" class="fnanchor">3388</a>, and Abrotonum<a id="FNanchor_3389" href="#Footnote_3389" class="fnanchor">3389</a>,
and the second, surnamed the Greater, Leptis<a id="FNanchor_3390" href="#Footnote_3390" class="fnanchor">3390</a>.</p>

<p>We next come to the Greater Syrtis, 625 miles in circumference,
and at the entrance 312 miles in width; next
after which dwells the nation of the Cisippades. At the
bottom of this gulf was the coast of the Lotophagi, whom
some writers have called the Alachroæ<a id="FNanchor_3391" href="#Footnote_3391" class="fnanchor">3391</a>, extending as far as
the Altars of the Philæni<a id="FNanchor_3392" href="#Footnote_3392" class="fnanchor">3392</a>; these Altars are formed of heaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
of sand. On passing these, not far from the shore there is
a vast swamp<a id="FNanchor_3393" href="#Footnote_3393" class="fnanchor">3393</a> which receives the river Triton<a id="FNanchor_3394" href="#Footnote_3394" class="fnanchor">3394</a> and from it
takes its name: by Callimachus it is called Pallantias<a id="FNanchor_3395" href="#Footnote_3395" class="fnanchor">3395</a>, and
is said by him to be on the nearer side of the Lesser Syrtis;
many other writers however place it between the two Syrtes.
The promontory which bounds the Greater Syrtis has the
name of Borion<a id="FNanchor_3396" href="#Footnote_3396" class="fnanchor">3396</a>; beyond it is the province of Cyrene.</p>

<p>Africa, from the river Ampsaga to this limit, includes
516 peoples, who are subject to the Roman sway, of which
six are colonies; among them Uthina<a id="FNanchor_3397" href="#Footnote_3397" class="fnanchor">3397</a> and Tuburbi<a id="FNanchor_3398" href="#Footnote_3398" class="fnanchor">3398</a>, besides
those already mentioned. The towns enjoying the
rights of Roman citizens are fifteen in number, of which
I shall mention, as lying in the interior, those of Assuræ<a id="FNanchor_3399" href="#Footnote_3399" class="fnanchor">3399</a>,
Abutucum, Aborium, Canopicum<a id="FNanchor_3400" href="#Footnote_3400" class="fnanchor">3400</a>, Cilma<a id="FNanchor_3401" href="#Footnote_3401" class="fnanchor">3401</a>, Simithium, Thunusidium,
Tuburnicum, Tynidrumum, Tibiga, the two towns
called Ucita, the Greater and the Lesser, and Vaga. There
is also one town with Latin rights, Uzalita by name, and
one town of tributaries, Castra Cornelia<a id="FNanchor_3402" href="#Footnote_3402" class="fnanchor">3402</a>. The free towns
are thirty in number, among which we may mention, in the
interior, those of Acholla<a id="FNanchor_3403" href="#Footnote_3403" class="fnanchor">3403</a>, Aggarita, Avina, Abzirita, Canopita,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
Melizita, Matera, Salaphita, Tusdrita<a id="FNanchor_3404" href="#Footnote_3404" class="fnanchor">3404</a>, Tiphica, Tunica<a id="FNanchor_3405" href="#Footnote_3405" class="fnanchor">3405</a>,
Theuda, Tagasta<a id="FNanchor_3406" href="#Footnote_3406" class="fnanchor">3406</a>, Tiga<a id="FNanchor_3407" href="#Footnote_3407" class="fnanchor">3407</a>, Ulusubrita, a second Vaga, Visa, and
Zama<a id="FNanchor_3408" href="#Footnote_3408" class="fnanchor">3408</a>. Of the remaining number, most of them should be
called, in strictness, not only cities, but nations even; such
for instance as the Natabudes, the Capsitani<a id="FNanchor_3409" href="#Footnote_3409" class="fnanchor">3409</a>, the Musulami,
the Sabarbares, the Massyli<a id="FNanchor_3410" href="#Footnote_3410" class="fnanchor">3410</a>, the Nisives, the Vamacures,
the Cinithi, the Musuni, the Marchubii<a id="FNanchor_3411" href="#Footnote_3411" class="fnanchor">3411</a>, and the whole
of Gætulia<a id="FNanchor_3412" href="#Footnote_3412" class="fnanchor">3412</a>, as far as the river Nigris<a id="FNanchor_3413" href="#Footnote_3413" class="fnanchor">3413</a>, which separates Africa proper from Æthiopia.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_5">CHAP. 5. (5.)—CYRENAICA.</h3></div>

<p>The region of Cyrenaica, also called Pentapolis<a id="FNanchor_3414" href="#Footnote_3414" class="fnanchor">3414</a>, is rendered
famous by the oracle of Hammon<a id="FNanchor_3415" href="#Footnote_3415" class="fnanchor">3415</a>, which is distant
400 miles from the city of Cyrene; also by the Fountain of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
the Sun<a id="FNanchor_3416" href="#Footnote_3416" class="fnanchor">3416</a> there, and five cities in especial, those of Berenice<a id="FNanchor_3417" href="#Footnote_3417" class="fnanchor">3417</a>,
Arsinoë<a id="FNanchor_3418" href="#Footnote_3418" class="fnanchor">3418</a>, Ptolemais<a id="FNanchor_3419" href="#Footnote_3419" class="fnanchor">3419</a>, Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_3420" href="#Footnote_3420" class="fnanchor">3420</a>, and Cyrene<a id="FNanchor_3421" href="#Footnote_3421" class="fnanchor">3421</a> itself.
Berenice is situate upon the outer promontory that bounds
the Syrtis; it was formerly called the city of the Hesperides
(previously mentioned<a id="FNanchor_3422" href="#Footnote_3422" class="fnanchor">3422</a>), according to the fables of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
Greeks, which very often change their localities. Not far
from the city, and running before it, is the river Lethon,
and with it a sacred grove, where the gardens of the Hesperides
are said to have formerly stood; this city is distant
from Leptis 375 miles. From Berenice to Arsinoë, commonly
called Teuchira, is forty-three miles; after which, at
a distance of twenty-two, we come to Ptolemais, the ancient
name of which was Barce; and at a distance of forty miles
from this last the Promontory of Phycus<a id="FNanchor_3423" href="#Footnote_3423" class="fnanchor">3423</a>, which extends far
away into the Cretan Sea, being 350 miles distant from Tænarum<a id="FNanchor_3424" href="#Footnote_3424" class="fnanchor">3424</a>,
the promontory of Laconia, and from Crete 225. After
passing this promontory we come to Cyrene, which stands
at a distance of eleven miles from the sea. From Phycus
to Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_3425" href="#Footnote_3425" class="fnanchor">3425</a> is twenty-four miles, and from thence to the
Chersonesus<a id="FNanchor_3426" href="#Footnote_3426" class="fnanchor">3426</a> eighty-eight; from which to Catabathmos<a id="FNanchor_3427" href="#Footnote_3427" class="fnanchor">3427</a> is a
distance of 216 miles. The Marmaridæ<a id="FNanchor_3428" href="#Footnote_3428" class="fnanchor">3428</a> inhabit this coast,
extending from almost the region of Parætonium<a id="FNanchor_3429" href="#Footnote_3429" class="fnanchor">3429</a> to the
Greater Syrtis; after them the Ararauceles, and then, upon
the coasts of the Syrtis, the Nasamones<a id="FNanchor_3430" href="#Footnote_3430" class="fnanchor">3430</a>, whom the Greeks
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
formerly called Mesammones, from the circumstance of
their being located in the very midst of sands<a id="FNanchor_3431" href="#Footnote_3431" class="fnanchor">3431</a>. The territory
of Cyrene, to a distance of fifteen miles from the shore,
is said to abound in trees, while for the same distance
beyond that district it is only suitable for the cultivation of
corn: after which, a tract of land, thirty miles in breadth
and 250 in length, is productive of nothing but laser [or
silphium<a id="FNanchor_3432" href="#Footnote_3432" class="fnanchor">3432</a>].</p>

<p>After the Nasamones we come to the dwellings of the
Asbystæ and the Macæ<a id="FNanchor_3433" href="#Footnote_3433" class="fnanchor">3433</a>, and beyond them, at eleven days’
journey to the west of the Greater Syrtis, the Amantes<a id="FNanchor_3434" href="#Footnote_3434" class="fnanchor">3434</a>, a
people also surrounded by sands in every direction. They
find water however without any difficulty at a depth mostly
of about two cubits, as their district receives the overflow of
the waters of Mauritania. They build houses with blocks
of salt<a id="FNanchor_3435" href="#Footnote_3435" class="fnanchor">3435</a>, which they cut out of their mountains just as we
do stone. From this nation to the Troglodytæ<a id="FNanchor_3436" href="#Footnote_3436" class="fnanchor">3436</a> the distance
is seven days’ journey in a south-westerly direction, a people
with whom our only intercourse is for the purpose of
procuring from them the precious stone which we call the
carbuncle, and which is brought from the interior of Æthiopia.
Upon the road to this last people, but turning off towards
the deserts of Africa, of which we have previously<a id="FNanchor_3437" href="#Footnote_3437" class="fnanchor">3437</a> made
mention as lying beyond the Lesser Syrtis, is the region of
Phazania<a id="FNanchor_3438" href="#Footnote_3438" class="fnanchor">3438</a>; the nation of Phazanii, belonging to which, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
well as the cities of Alele<a id="FNanchor_3439" href="#Footnote_3439" class="fnanchor">3439</a> and Cilliba<a id="FNanchor_3440" href="#Footnote_3440" class="fnanchor">3440</a>, we have subdued
by force of arms, as also Cydamus<a id="FNanchor_3441" href="#Footnote_3441" class="fnanchor">3441</a>, which lies over against
Sabrata. After passing these places a range of mountains
extends in a prolonged chain from east to west: these have
received from our people the name of the Black Mountains<a id="FNanchor_3442" href="#Footnote_3442" class="fnanchor">3442</a>,
either from the appearance which they naturally bear
of having been exposed to the action of fire, or else from the
fact that they have been scorched by the reflection of the
sun’s rays. Beyond it<a id="FNanchor_3443" href="#Footnote_3443" class="fnanchor">3443</a> is the desert, and then Talgæ, a city of
the Garamantes, and Debris, at which place there is a spring<a id="FNanchor_3444" href="#Footnote_3444" class="fnanchor">3444</a>,
the waters of which, from noon to midnight, are at boiling
heat, and then freeze for as many hours until the following
noon; Garama too, that most famous capital of the Garamantes;
all which places have been subdued by the Roman
arms. It was on this occasion that Cornelius Balbus<a id="FNanchor_3445" href="#Footnote_3445" class="fnanchor">3445</a> was
honoured with a triumph, the only foreigner indeed that was
ever honoured with the triumphal chariot, and presented
with the rights of a Roman citizen; for, although by birth
a native of Gades, the Roman citizenship was granted to him
as well as to the elder Balbus<a id="FNanchor_3446" href="#Footnote_3446" class="fnanchor">3446</a>, his uncle by the father’s side.
There is also this remarkable circumstance, that our writers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
have handed down to us the names of the cities above-mentioned
as having been taken by Balbus, and have informed
us that on the occasion of his triumph<a id="FNanchor_3447" href="#Footnote_3447" class="fnanchor">3447</a>, besides Cydamus
and Garama<a id="FNanchor_3448" href="#Footnote_3448" class="fnanchor">3448</a>, there were carried in the procession the
names and models of all the other nations and cities, in
the following order: the town of Tabudium<a id="FNanchor_3449" href="#Footnote_3449" class="fnanchor">3449</a>, the nation
of Niteris, the town of Nigligemella, the nation or town of
Bubeium<a id="FNanchor_3450" href="#Footnote_3450" class="fnanchor">3450</a>, the nation of Enipi, the town of Thuben, the
mountain known as the Black Mountain, Nitibrum, the
towns called Rapsa, the nation of Discera<a id="FNanchor_3451" href="#Footnote_3451" class="fnanchor">3451</a>, the town of
Debris<a id="FNanchor_3452" href="#Footnote_3452" class="fnanchor">3452</a>, the river Nathabur<a id="FNanchor_3453" href="#Footnote_3453" class="fnanchor">3453</a>, the town of Thapsagum<a id="FNanchor_3454" href="#Footnote_3454" class="fnanchor">3454</a>,
the nation of Nannagi, the town of Boin, the town of
Pege<a id="FNanchor_3455" href="#Footnote_3455" class="fnanchor">3455</a>, the river Dasibari; and then the towns, in the
following order, of Baracum, Buluba, Alasit, Galia, Balla,
Maxalla<a id="FNanchor_3456" href="#Footnote_3456" class="fnanchor">3456</a>, Zizama, and Mount Gyri<a id="FNanchor_3457" href="#Footnote_3457" class="fnanchor">3457</a>, which was preceded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
an inscription stating that this was the place where precious
stones were produced.</p>

<p>Up to the present time it has been found impracticable
to keep open the road that leads to the country of the
Garamantes, as the predatory bands of that nation have filled
up the wells with sand, which do not require to be dug for
to any great depth, if you only have a knowledge of the
locality. In the late war<a id="FNanchor_3458" href="#Footnote_3458" class="fnanchor">3458</a> however, which, at the beginning
of the reign of the Emperor Vespasian, the Romans carried
on with the people of Œa, a short cut of only four days’
journey was discovered; this road is known as the “Præter
Caput Saxi<a id="FNanchor_3459" href="#Footnote_3459" class="fnanchor">3459</a>.” The last place in the territory of Cyrenaica
is Catabathmos, consisting of a town, and a valley with a
sudden and steep descent. The length of Cyrenean Africa,
up to this boundary from the Lesser Syrtis, is 1060 miles;
and, so far as has been ascertained, it is 800<a id="FNanchor_3460" href="#Footnote_3460" class="fnanchor">3460</a> in breadth.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_6">CHAP. 6. (6.)—LIBYA MAREOTIS.</h3></div>

<p>The region that follows is called Libya Mareotis<a id="FNanchor_3461" href="#Footnote_3461" class="fnanchor">3461</a>, and
borders upon Egypt. It is held by the Marmaridæ, the
Adyrmachidæ, and, after them, the Mareotæ. The distance
from Catabathmos to Parætonium is eighty-six<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
miles. In this district is Apis<a id="FNanchor_3462" href="#Footnote_3462" class="fnanchor">3462</a>, a place rendered famous by
the religious belief of Egypt. From this town Parætonium
is distant sixty-two miles, and from thence to Alexandria
the distance is 200 miles, the breadth of the district being
169. Eratosthenes says that it is 525 miles by land from
Cyrene to Alexandria; while Agrippa gives the length of
the whole of Africa from the Atlantic Sea, and including
Lower Egypt, as 3040 miles. Polybius and Eratosthenes,
who are generally considered as remarkable for their extreme
correctness, state the length to be, from the ocean to Great
Carthage 1100 miles, and from Carthage to Canopus, the
nearest mouth of the Nile, 1628 miles; while Isidorus speaks
of the distance from Tingi to Canopus as being 3599 miles.
Artemidorus makes this last distance forty miles less than
Isidorus.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_7">CHAP. 7. (7.)—THE ISLANDS IN THE VICINITY OF AFRICA.</h3></div>

<p>These seas contain not so very many islands. The most
famous among them is Meninx<a id="FNanchor_3463" href="#Footnote_3463" class="fnanchor">3463</a>, twenty-five miles in length
and twenty-two in breadth: by Eratosthenes it is called
Lotophagitis. This island has two towns, Meninx on the
side which faces Africa, and Troas on the other; it is situate
off the promontory which lies on the right-hand side of the
Lesser Syrtis, at a distance of a mile and a half. One hundred
miles from this island, and opposite the promontory
that lies on the left, is the free island of Cercina<a id="FNanchor_3464" href="#Footnote_3464" class="fnanchor">3464</a>, with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
city of the same name. It is twenty-five miles long, and
half that breadth at the place where it is the widest, but
not more than five miles across at the extremity: the diminutive
island of Cercinitis<a id="FNanchor_3465" href="#Footnote_3465" class="fnanchor">3465</a>, which looks towards Carthage,
is united to it by a bridge. At a distance of nearly
fifty miles from these is the island of Lopadusa<a id="FNanchor_3466" href="#Footnote_3466" class="fnanchor">3466</a>, six miles
in length; and beyond it Gaulos and Galata, the soil of which
kills the scorpion, that noxious reptile of Africa. It is
also said that the scorpion will not live at Clypea; opposite
to which place lies the island of Cosyra<a id="FNanchor_3467" href="#Footnote_3467" class="fnanchor">3467</a>, with a town of the
same name. Opposite to the Gulf of Carthage are the two
islands known as the Ægimuri<a id="FNanchor_3468" href="#Footnote_3468" class="fnanchor">3468</a>; the Altars<a id="FNanchor_3469" href="#Footnote_3469" class="fnanchor">3469</a>, which are
rather rocks than islands, lie more between Sicily and Sardinia.
There are some authors who state that these rocks
were once inhabited, but that they have gradually subsided
in the sea.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_8">CHAP. 8. (8.)—COUNTRIES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF AFRICA.</h3></div>

<p>If we pass through the interior of Africa in a southerly
direction, beyond the Gætuli, after having traversed the
intervening deserts, we shall find, first of all the Liby-Egyptians<a id="FNanchor_3470" href="#Footnote_3470" class="fnanchor">3470</a>,
and then the country where the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
Leucæthiopians<a id="FNanchor_3471" href="#Footnote_3471" class="fnanchor">3471</a> dwell. Beyond<a id="FNanchor_3472" href="#Footnote_3472" class="fnanchor">3472</a> these are the Nigritæ<a id="FNanchor_3473" href="#Footnote_3473" class="fnanchor">3473</a>, nations of
Æthiopia, so called from the river Nigris<a id="FNanchor_3474" href="#Footnote_3474" class="fnanchor">3474</a>, which has been
previously mentioned, the Gymnetes<a id="FNanchor_3475" href="#Footnote_3475" class="fnanchor">3475</a>, surnamed Pharusii,
and, on the very margin of the ocean, the Perorsi<a id="FNanchor_3476" href="#Footnote_3476" class="fnanchor">3476</a>, whom
we have already spoken of as lying on the boundaries
of Mauritania. After passing all these peoples, there are
vast deserts towards the east until we come to the Garamantes,
the Augylæ, and the Troglodytæ; the opinion of
those being exceedingly well founded who place two Æthiopias
beyond the deserts of Africa, and more particularly
that expressed by Homer<a id="FNanchor_3477" href="#Footnote_3477" class="fnanchor">3477</a>, who tells us that the Æthiopians
are divided into two nations, those of the east and those of
the west. The river Nigris has the same characteristics as
the Nile; it produces the calamus, the papyrus, and just
the same animals, and it rises at the same seasons of the
year. Its source is between the Tarrælian Æthiopians
and the Œcalicæ. Magium, the city of the latter people,
has been placed by some writers amid the deserts, and, next<span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
to them the Atlantes; then the Ægipani, half men, half
beasts, the Blemmyæ<a id="FNanchor_3478" href="#Footnote_3478" class="fnanchor">3478</a>, the Gamphasantes, the Satyri, and
the Himantopodes.</p>

<p>The Atlantes<a id="FNanchor_3479" href="#Footnote_3479" class="fnanchor">3479</a>, if we believe what is said, have lost all
characteristics of humanity; for there is no mode of distinguishing
each other among them by names, and as they look
upon the rising and the setting sun, they give utterance to
direful imprecations against it, as being deadly to themselves
and their lands; nor are they visited with dreams<a id="FNanchor_3480" href="#Footnote_3480" class="fnanchor">3480</a>, like
the rest of mortals. The Troglodytæ make excavations in
the earth, which serve them for dwellings; the flesh of serpents
is their food; they have no articulate voice, but
only utter a kind of squeaking noise<a id="FNanchor_3481" href="#Footnote_3481" class="fnanchor">3481</a>; and thus are they
utterly destitute of all means of communication by language.
The Garamantes have no institution of marriage among
them, and live in promiscuous concubinage with their
women. The Augylæ worship no deities<a id="FNanchor_3482" href="#Footnote_3482" class="fnanchor">3482</a> but the gods of the

are unacquainted with war<a id="FNanchor_3483" href="#Footnote_3483" class="fnanchor">3483</a>, hold no intercourse whatever
with strangers. The Blemmyæ are said to have no heads,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
their mouths and eyes being seated in their breasts. The
Satyri<a id="FNanchor_3484" href="#Footnote_3484" class="fnanchor">3484</a>, beyond their figure, have nothing in common with
the manners of the human race, and the form of the Ægipani<a id="FNanchor_3485" href="#Footnote_3485" class="fnanchor">3485</a>
is such as is commonly represented in paintings. The
Himantopodes<a id="FNanchor_3486" href="#Footnote_3486" class="fnanchor">3486</a> are a race of people with feet resembling
thongs, upon which they move along by nature with a serpentine,
crawling kind of gait. The Pharusii, descended
from the ancient Persians, are said to have been the companions
of Hercules when on his expedition to the Hesperides.
Beyond the above, I have met with nothing relative to

<p>Joining on to Africa is Asia, the extent of which, according
to Timosthenes, from the Canopic mouth of the Nile
to the mouth of the Euxine, is 2639 miles. From the
mouth of the Euxine to that of Lake Mæotis is, according to
Eratosthenes, 1545 miles. The whole distance to the Tanais,
including Egypt, is, according to Artemidorus and
Isidorus, 6375<a id="FNanchor_3488" href="#Footnote_3488" class="fnanchor">3488</a> miles. The seas of Egypt, which are several<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
in number, have received their names from those who dwell
upon their shores, for which reason they will be mentioned
together.</p>

<p>Egypt is the country which lies next to Africa; in the interior
it runs in a southerly direction, as far as the territory
of the Æthiopians, who lie extended at the back of it. The
river Nile, dividing itself, forms on the right and left the
boundary of its lower part, which it embraces on every side<a id="FNanchor_3489" href="#Footnote_3489" class="fnanchor">3489</a>.
By the Canopic mouth of that river it is separated from
Africa, and by the Pelusiac from Asia, there being a distance
between the two of 170 miles. For this reason it is that
some persons have reckoned Egypt among the islands, the
Nile so dividing itself as to give a triangular form to the
land which it encloses: from which circumstance also
many persons have named Egypt the Delta<a id="FNanchor_3490" href="#Footnote_3490" class="fnanchor">3490</a>, after that of
the Greek letter so called. The distance from the spot
where the channel of the river first divides into branches, to
the Canopic mouth, is 146 miles, and to the Pelusiac, 166.</p>

<p>The upper part of Egypt, which borders on Æthiopia, is
known as Thebais. This district is divided into prefectures
of towns, which are generally designated as “Nomes.”
These are Ombites<a id="FNanchor_3491" href="#Footnote_3491" class="fnanchor">3491</a>, Apollopolites<a id="FNanchor_3492" href="#Footnote_3492" class="fnanchor">3492</a>, Hermonthites<a id="FNanchor_3493" href="#Footnote_3493" class="fnanchor">3493</a>, Thinites<a id="FNanchor_3494" href="#Footnote_3494" class="fnanchor">3494</a>,
Phaturites<a id="FNanchor_3495" href="#Footnote_3495" class="fnanchor">3495</a>, Coptites<a id="FNanchor_3496" href="#Footnote_3496" class="fnanchor">3496</a>, Tentyrites<a id="FNanchor_3497" href="#Footnote_3497" class="fnanchor">3497</a>, Diopolites<a id="FNanchor_3498" href="#Footnote_3498" class="fnanchor">3498</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
Antæopolites<a id="FNanchor_3499" href="#Footnote_3499" class="fnanchor">3499</a>, Aphroditopolites<a id="FNanchor_3500" href="#Footnote_3500" class="fnanchor">3500</a>, and Lycopolites<a id="FNanchor_3501" href="#Footnote_3501" class="fnanchor">3501</a>. The district
which lies in the vicinity of Pelusium contains the
following Nomes, Pharbæthites, Bubastites<a id="FNanchor_3502" href="#Footnote_3502" class="fnanchor">3502</a>, Sethroites,
and Tanites<a id="FNanchor_3503" href="#Footnote_3503" class="fnanchor">3503</a>. The remaining Nomes are those called the
Arabian; the Hammonian, which lies on the road to the
oracle of Jupiter Hammon; and those known by the names
of Oxyrynchites, Leontopolites, Athribites<a id="FNanchor_3504" href="#Footnote_3504" class="fnanchor">3504</a>, Cynopolites<a id="FNanchor_3505" href="#Footnote_3505" class="fnanchor">3505</a>,
Hermopolites<a id="FNanchor_3506" href="#Footnote_3506" class="fnanchor">3506</a>, Xoites, Mendesium, Sebennytes<a id="FNanchor_3507" href="#Footnote_3507" class="fnanchor">3507</a>, Cabasites,
Latopolites, Heliopolites, Prosopites, Panopolites, Busirites<a id="FNanchor_3508" href="#Footnote_3508" class="fnanchor">3508</a>,
Onuphites<a id="FNanchor_3509" href="#Footnote_3509" class="fnanchor">3509</a>, Saïtes<a id="FNanchor_3510" href="#Footnote_3510" class="fnanchor">3510</a>, Ptenethu, Phthemphu<a id="FNanchor_3511" href="#Footnote_3511" class="fnanchor">3511</a>, Naucratites<a id="FNanchor_3512" href="#Footnote_3512" class="fnanchor">3512</a>,
Metelites, Gynæcopolites, Menelaites,—all in the region of
Alexandria, besides Mareotis in Libya.</p>

<p>Heracleopolites<a id="FNanchor_3513" href="#Footnote_3513" class="fnanchor">3513</a> is a Nome on an island<a href="#Footnote_3513" class="fnanchor">3513</a> of the Nile,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
fifty miles in length, upon which there is a city, called the
‘City of Hercules.’ There are two places called Arsinoïtes<a id="FNanchor_3514" href="#Footnote_3514" class="fnanchor">3514</a>:
these and Memphites<a id="FNanchor_3515" href="#Footnote_3515" class="fnanchor">3515</a> extend to the apex<a id="FNanchor_3516" href="#Footnote_3516" class="fnanchor">3516</a> of the Delta; adjoining
to which, on the side of Africa, are the two Nomes
of Oasites<a id="FNanchor_3517" href="#Footnote_3517" class="fnanchor">3517</a>. Some writers vary in some of these names and
substitute for them other Nomes, such as Heroöpolites<a id="FNanchor_3518" href="#Footnote_3518" class="fnanchor">3518</a>
and Crocodilopolites<a id="FNanchor_3519" href="#Footnote_3519" class="fnanchor">3519</a>. Between Arsinoïtes and Memphites,
a lake<a id="FNanchor_3520" href="#Footnote_3520" class="fnanchor">3520</a>, 250 miles, or, according to what Mucianus
says, 450 miles in circumference and fifty paces deep,
has been formed by artificial means: after the king by
whose orders it was made, it is called by the name of Mœris.
The distance from thence to Memphis is nearly sixty-two
miles, a place which was formerly the citadel of the kings of
Egypt; from thence to the oracle of Hammon it is twelve
days’ journey. Memphis is fifteen miles from the spot where
the river Nile divides into the different channels which we
have mentioned as forming the Delta.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span></p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_10">CHAP. 10.—THE RIVER NILE.</h3></div>

<p>The sources of the Nile<a id="FNanchor_3521" href="#Footnote_3521" class="fnanchor">3521</a> are unascertained, and, travelling
as it does for an immense distance through deserts and burning
sands, it is only known to us by common report, having
neither experienced the vicissitudes of warfare, nor been
visited by those arms which have so effectually explored all
other regions. It rises, so far indeed as King Juba was
enabled to ascertain, in a mountain<a id="FNanchor_3522" href="#Footnote_3522" class="fnanchor">3522</a> of Lower Mauritania,
not far from the ocean; immediately after which it forms a
lake of standing water, which bears the name of Nilides<a id="FNanchor_3523" href="#Footnote_3523" class="fnanchor">3523</a>.
In this lake are found the several kinds of fish known by
the names of alabeta<a id="FNanchor_3524" href="#Footnote_3524" class="fnanchor">3524</a>, coracinus, and silurus; a crocodile
also was brought thence as a proof that this really is the
Nile, and was consecrated by Juba himself in the temple of
Isis at Cæsarea<a id="FNanchor_3525" href="#Footnote_3525" class="fnanchor">3525</a>, where it may be seen at the present day.
In addition to these facts, it has been observed that the
waters of the Nile rise in the same proportion in which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
snows and rains of Mauritania increase. Pouring forth from
this lake, the river disdains to flow through arid and sandy
deserts, and for a distance of several days’ journey conceals
itself; after which it bursts forth at another lake of greater
magnitude in the country of the Massæsyli<a id="FNanchor_3526" href="#Footnote_3526" class="fnanchor">3526</a>, a people of
Mauritania Cæsariensis, and thence casts a glance around, as
it were, upon the communities of men in its vicinity, giving
proofs of its identity in the same peculiarities of the animals
which it produces. It then buries itself once again in the
sands of the desert, and remains concealed for a distance of
twenty days’ journey, till it has reached the confines of Æthiopia.
Here, when it has once more become sensible of the presence
of man, it again emerges, at the same source, in all probability,
to which writers have given the name of Niger, or
Black. After this, forming the boundary-line between Africa
and Æthiopia, its banks, though not immediately peopled by
man, are the resort of numbers of wild beasts and animals
of various kinds. Giving birth in its course to dense
forests of trees, it travels through the middle of Æthiopia,
under the name of Astapus, a word which signifies, in the
language of the nations who dwell in those regions, “water
issuing from the shades below.” Proceeding onwards, it
divides<a id="FNanchor_3527" href="#Footnote_3527" class="fnanchor">3527</a> innumerable islands in its course, and some of them
of such vast magnitude, that although its tide runs with the
greatest rapidity, it is not less than five days in passing
them. When making the circuit of Meroë, the most
famous of these islands, the left branch of the river is called
Astobores<a id="FNanchor_3528" href="#Footnote_3528" class="fnanchor">3528</a>, or, in other words, “an arm of the water that
issues from the shades,” while the right arm has the name
of Astosapes<a id="FNanchor_3529" href="#Footnote_3529" class="fnanchor">3529</a>, which adds to its original signification the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
meaning of “side<a id="FNanchor_3530" href="#Footnote_3530" class="fnanchor">3530</a>.” It does not obtain the name of “Nile”
until its waters have again met and are united in a single
stream; and even then, for some miles both above and
below the point of confluence, it has the name of Siris.
Homer has given to the whole of this river the name of
Ægyptus, while other writers again have called it Triton<a id="FNanchor_3531" href="#Footnote_3531" class="fnanchor">3531</a>.
Every now and then its course is interrupted by islands which
intervene, and which only serve as so many incentives to
add to the impetuosity of its torrent; and though at last
it is hemmed in by mountains on either side, in no part is
the tide more rapid and precipitate. Its waters then
hastening onwards, it is borne along to the spot in the country of
the Æthiopians which is known by the name of “Catadupi<a id="FNanchor_3532" href="#Footnote_3532" class="fnanchor">3532</a>;”
where, at the last Cataract<a id="FNanchor_3533" href="#Footnote_3533" class="fnanchor">3533</a>, the complaint is, not that it
flows, but that it rushes, with an immense noise between the
rocks that lie in its way: after which it becomes more
smooth, the violence of its waters is broken and subdued,
and, wearied out as it were by the length of the distance it
has travelled, it discharges itself, though by many mouths<a id="FNanchor_3534" href="#Footnote_3534" class="fnanchor">3534</a>,
into the Egyptian sea. During certain days of the year,
however, the volume of its waters is greatly increased, and as it
traverses the whole of Egypt, it inundates the earth, and,
by so doing, greatly promotes its fertility.</p>

<p>There have been various reasons suggested for this increase
of the river. Of these, however, the most probable are,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
either that its waters are driven back by the Etesian winds<a id="FNanchor_3535" href="#Footnote_3535" class="fnanchor">3535</a>,
which are blowing at this season of the year from an opposite
direction, and that the sea which lies beyond is driven
into the mouths of the river; or else that its waters are
swollen by the summer rains of Æthiopia<a id="FNanchor_3536" href="#Footnote_3536" class="fnanchor">3536</a>, which fall from
the clouds conveyed thither by the Etesian winds from
other parts of the earth. Timæus the mathematician has
alleged a reason of an occult nature: he says that the source
of the river is known by the name of Phiala, and that the
stream buries itself in channels underground, where it sends
forth vapours generated by the heat among the steaming
rocks amid which it conceals itself; but that, during the days
of the inundation, in consequence of the sun approaching
nearer to the earth, the waters are drawn forth by the
influence of his heat, and on being thus exposed to the
air, overflow; after which, in order that it may not be
utterly dried up, the stream hides itself once more. He
says that this takes place at the rising of the Dog-Star,
when the sun enters the sign of Leo, and stands in a vertical
position over the source of the river, at which time at
that spot there is no shadow thrown. Most authors, however,
are of opinion, on the contrary, that the river flows in greater
volume when the sun takes his departure for the north, which
he does when he enters the signs of Cancer and Leo, because
its waters then are not dried up to so great an extent; while
on the other hand, when he returns towards the south pole and
re-enters Capricorn, its waters are absorbed by the heat,
and consequently flow in less abundance. If there is
any one inclined to be of opinion, with Timæus, that the
waters of the river may be drawn out of the earth by the
heat, it will be as well for him to bear in mind the fact, that
the absence of shadow is a phænomenon which lasts continuously<a id="FNanchor_3537" href="#Footnote_3537" class="fnanchor">3537</a>
in these regions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span></p>

<p>The Nile begins to increase at the next new moon after
the summer solstice, and rises slowly and gradually as the
sun passes through the sign of Cancer; it is at its greatest
height while the sun is passing through Leo, and it falls as
slowly and gradually as it arose while he is passing through
the sign of Virgo. It has totally subsided between its
banks, as we learn from Herodotus, on the hundredth day,
when the sun has entered Libra. While it is rising it has been
pronounced criminal for kings or prefects even to sail upon
its waters. The measure of its increase is ascertained by
means of wells<a id="FNanchor_3538" href="#Footnote_3538" class="fnanchor">3538</a>. Its most desirable height is sixteen cubits<a id="FNanchor_3539" href="#Footnote_3539" class="fnanchor">3539</a>;
if the waters do not attain that height, the overflow is not
universal; but if they exceed that measure, by their slowness
in receding they tend to retard the process of cultivation.
In the latter case the time for sowing is lost, in consequence
of the moisture of the soil; in the former, the ground is so
parched that the seed-time comes to no purpose. The country
has reason to make careful note of either extreme. When
the water rises to only twelve cubits, it experiences the
horrors of famine; when it attains thirteen, hunger is still
the result; a rise of fourteen cubits is productive of gladness;
a rise of fifteen sets all anxieties at rest; while an
increase of sixteen is productive of unbounded transports of
joy. The greatest increase known, up to the present time,
is that of eighteen cubits, which took place in the time
of the Emperor Claudius; the smallest rise was that of five,
in the year of the battle of Pharsalia<a id="FNanchor_3540" href="#Footnote_3540" class="fnanchor">3540</a>, the river by this
prodigy testifying its horror, as it were, at the murder of
Pompeius Magnus. When the waters have reached their
greatest height, the people open the embankments and admit
them to the lands. As each district is left by the waters,
the business of sowing commences. This is the only river
in existence that emits no vapours<a id="FNanchor_3541" href="#Footnote_3541" class="fnanchor">3541</a>.</p>

<p>The Nile first enters the Egyptian territory at Syene<a id="FNanchor_3542" href="#Footnote_3542" class="fnanchor">3542</a>, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
the frontiers of Æthiopia; that is the name of a peninsula a
mile in circumference, upon which Castra<a id="FNanchor_3543" href="#Footnote_3543" class="fnanchor">3543</a> is situate, on the
side of Arabia. Opposite to it are the four islands of
Philæ<a id="FNanchor_3544" href="#Footnote_3544" class="fnanchor">3544</a>, at a distance of 600 miles from the place where
the Nile divides into two channels; at which spot, as
we have already stated, the Delta, as it is called, begins.
This, at least, is the distance, according to Artemidorus,
who also informs us that there were in it 250 towns; Juba
says, however, that the distance between these places is 400
miles. <a id="Aristocreon">Aristocreon</a> says that the distance from Elephantis
to the sea is 750 miles; Elephantis<a id="FNanchor_3545" href="#Footnote_3545" class="fnanchor">3545</a> being an inhabited
island four miles below the last Cataract, sixteen<a id="FNanchor_3546" href="#Footnote_3546" class="fnanchor">3546</a> beyond
Syene, 585 from Alexandria, and the extreme limit of the
navigation of Egypt. To such an extent as this have the
above-named authors<a id="FNanchor_3547" href="#Footnote_3547" class="fnanchor">3547</a> been mistaken! This island is the
place of rendezvous for the vessels of the Æthiopians; they
are made to fold up<a id="FNanchor_3548" href="#Footnote_3548" class="fnanchor">3548</a>, and the people carry them on their
shoulders whenever they come to the Cataracts.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_11">CHAP. 11.—THE CITIES OF EGYPT.</h3></div>

<p>Egypt, besides its boast of extreme antiquity, asserts that
it contained, in the reign of King Amasis<a id="FNanchor_3549" href="#Footnote_3549" class="fnanchor">3549</a>, 20,000 inhabited
cities: in our day they are still very numerous, though no
longer of any particular note. Still however we find the
following ones mentioned as of great renown—the city of
Apollo<a id="FNanchor_3550" href="#Footnote_3550" class="fnanchor">3550</a>; next, that of Leucothea<a id="FNanchor_3551" href="#Footnote_3551" class="fnanchor">3551</a>; then Great Diospolis<a id="FNanchor_3552" href="#Footnote_3552" class="fnanchor">3552</a>,
otherwise Thebes, known to fame for its hundred gates;
Coptos<a id="FNanchor_3553" href="#Footnote_3553" class="fnanchor">3553</a>, which from its proximity to the Nile, forms its
nearest emporium for the merchandise of India and Arabia;
then the town of Venus<a id="FNanchor_3554" href="#Footnote_3554" class="fnanchor">3554</a>, and then another town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
Jupiter<a id="FNanchor_3555" href="#Footnote_3555" class="fnanchor">3555</a>. After this comes Tentyris<a id="FNanchor_3556" href="#Footnote_3556" class="fnanchor">3556</a>, below which is Abydus<a id="FNanchor_3557" href="#Footnote_3557" class="fnanchor">3557</a>, the
royal abode of Memnon, and famous for a temple of Osiris<a id="FNanchor_3558" href="#Footnote_3558" class="fnanchor">3558</a>,
which is situate in Libya<a id="FNanchor_3559" href="#Footnote_3559" class="fnanchor">3559</a>, at a distance from the river of
seven miles and a half. Next to it comes Ptolemais<a id="FNanchor_3560" href="#Footnote_3560" class="fnanchor">3560</a>, then
Panopolis<a id="FNanchor_3561" href="#Footnote_3561" class="fnanchor">3561</a>, and then another town of Venus<a id="FNanchor_3562" href="#Footnote_3562" class="fnanchor">3562</a>, and, on the
Libyan side, Lycon<a id="FNanchor_3563" href="#Footnote_3563" class="fnanchor">3563</a>, where the mountains form the boundary
of the province of Thebais. On passing these, we come
to the towns of Mercury<a id="FNanchor_3564" href="#Footnote_3564" class="fnanchor">3564</a>, Alabastron<a id="FNanchor_3565" href="#Footnote_3565" class="fnanchor">3565</a>, the town of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_418">418</span>
Dogs<a id="FNanchor_3566" href="#Footnote_3566" class="fnanchor">3566</a>, and that of Hercules already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_3567" href="#Footnote_3567" class="fnanchor">3567</a>. We next
come to Arsinoë<a id="FNanchor_3568" href="#Footnote_3568" class="fnanchor">3568</a>, and Memphis<a id="FNanchor_3569" href="#Footnote_3569" class="fnanchor">3569</a>, which has been previously
mentioned; between which last and the Nome of Arsinoïtes,
upon the Libyan side, are the towers known as the
Pyramids, the Labyrinth<a id="FNanchor_3570" href="#Footnote_3570" class="fnanchor">3570</a> on Lake Mœris, in the construction
of which no wood was employed, and the town of
Crialon<a id="FNanchor_3571" href="#Footnote_3571" class="fnanchor">3571</a>. Besides these, there is one place in the interior,
on the confines of Arabia, of great celebrity, the City of
the Sun<a id="FNanchor_3572" href="#Footnote_3572" class="fnanchor">3572</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_419">419</span></p>

<p>(10.) With the greatest justice, however, we may lavish
our praises upon Alexandria, built by Alexander the Great
on the shores of the Egyptian Sea, upon the soil of Africa,
at twelve miles’ distance from the Canopic Mouth and near
Lake Mareotis<a id="FNanchor_3573" href="#Footnote_3573" class="fnanchor">3573</a>; the spot having previously borne the name
of Rhacotes. The plan of this city was designed by the
architect Dinochares<a id="FNanchor_3574" href="#Footnote_3574" class="fnanchor">3574</a>, who is memorable for the genius which
he displayed in many ways. Building the city upon a wide
space<a id="FNanchor_3575" href="#Footnote_3575" class="fnanchor">3575</a> of ground fifteen miles in circumference, he formed
it in the circular shape of a Macedonian chlamys<a id="FNanchor_3576" href="#Footnote_3576" class="fnanchor">3576</a>, uneven
at the edge, giving it an angular projection on the right and
left; while at the same time he devoted one-fifth part of the
site to the royal palace.</p>

<p>Lake Mareotis, which lies on the south side of the city,
is connected by a canal which joins it to the Canopic mouth,
and serves for the purposes of communication with the interior.
It has also a great number of islands, and is thirty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_420">420</span>
miles across, and 150 in circumference, according to Claudius
Cæsar. Other writers say that it is forty schœni in length,
making the schœnum to be thirty stadia; hence, according
to them, it is 150 miles<a id="FNanchor_3577" href="#Footnote_3577" class="fnanchor">3577</a> in length and the same in
breadth.</p>

<p>There are also, in the latter part of the course of the Nile,
many towns of considerable celebrity, and more especially
those which have given their names to the mouths of the
river—I do not mean, all the mouths, for there are no less
than twelve of them, as well as four others, which the people
call the False Mouths<a id="FNanchor_3578" href="#Footnote_3578" class="fnanchor">3578</a>. I allude to the seven more famous
ones, the Canopic<a id="FNanchor_3579" href="#Footnote_3579" class="fnanchor">3579</a> Mouth, next to Alexandria, those of Bolbitine<a id="FNanchor_3580" href="#Footnote_3580" class="fnanchor">3580</a>,
Sebennys<a id="FNanchor_3581" href="#Footnote_3581" class="fnanchor">3581</a>, Phatnis<a id="FNanchor_3582" href="#Footnote_3582" class="fnanchor">3582</a>, Mendes<a id="FNanchor_3583" href="#Footnote_3583" class="fnanchor">3583</a>, Tanis<a id="FNanchor_3584" href="#Footnote_3584" class="fnanchor">3584</a>, and, last of all,
Pelusium<a id="FNanchor_3585" href="#Footnote_3585" class="fnanchor">3585</a>. Besides the above there are the towns of Butos<a id="FNanchor_3586" href="#Footnote_3586" class="fnanchor">3586</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_421">421</span>
Pharbæthos<a id="FNanchor_3587" href="#Footnote_3587" class="fnanchor">3587</a>, Leontopolis<a id="FNanchor_3588" href="#Footnote_3588" class="fnanchor">3588</a>, Athribis<a id="FNanchor_3589" href="#Footnote_3589" class="fnanchor">3589</a>, the town of Isis<a id="FNanchor_3590" href="#Footnote_3590" class="fnanchor">3590</a>,

which last some writers call that the Naucratitic Mouth,
which is by others called the Heracleotic, and mention it

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_12">CHAP. 12. (11.)—THE COASTS OF ARABIA, SITUATE ON THE
EGYPTIAN SEA.</h3></div>

<p>Beyond the Pelusiac Mouth is Arabia<a id="FNanchor_3597" href="#Footnote_3597" class="fnanchor">3597</a>, which extends to
the Red Sea, and joins the Arabia known by the surname of
Happy<a id="FNanchor_3598" href="#Footnote_3598" class="fnanchor">3598</a>, so famous for its perfumes and its wealth. This<a id="FNanchor_3599" href="#Footnote_3599" class="fnanchor">3599</a>
is called Arabia of the Catabanes<a id="FNanchor_3600" href="#Footnote_3600" class="fnanchor">3600</a>, the Esbonitæ<a id="FNanchor_3601" href="#Footnote_3601" class="fnanchor">3601</a>, and the
Scenitæ<a id="FNanchor_3602" href="#Footnote_3602" class="fnanchor">3602</a>; it is remarkable for its sterility, except in the parts
where it joins up to Syria, and it has nothing remarkable
in it except Mount Casius<a id="FNanchor_3603" href="#Footnote_3603" class="fnanchor">3603</a>. The Arabian nations of the
Canchlæi<a id="FNanchor_3604" href="#Footnote_3604" class="fnanchor">3604</a> join these on the east, and, on the south the
Cedrei<a id="FNanchor_3605" href="#Footnote_3605" class="fnanchor">3605</a>, both of which peoples are adjoining to the Nabatæi<a id="FNanchor_3606" href="#Footnote_3606" class="fnanchor">3606</a>.
The two gulfs of the Red Sea, where it borders upon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_423">423</span>
Egypt, are called the Heroöpolitic<a id="FNanchor_3607" href="#Footnote_3607" class="fnanchor">3607</a> and the Ælanitic<a id="FNanchor_3608" href="#Footnote_3608" class="fnanchor">3608</a>. Between
the two towns of Ælana<a id="FNanchor_3609" href="#Footnote_3609" class="fnanchor">3609</a> and Gaza<a id="FNanchor_3610" href="#Footnote_3610" class="fnanchor">3610</a> upon our sea<a id="FNanchor_3611" href="#Footnote_3611" class="fnanchor">3611</a>,
there is a distance of 150 miles. Agrippa says that Arsinoë<a id="FNanchor_3612" href="#Footnote_3612" class="fnanchor">3612</a>,
a town on the Red Sea, is, by way of the desert, 125 miles
from Pelusium. How different the characteristics impressed
by nature upon two places separated by so small a distance!</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_13">CHAP. 13. (12.)—SYRIA.</h3></div>

<p>Next to these countries Syria occupies the coast, once the
greatest of lands, and distinguished by many names; for the
part which joins up to Arabia was formerly called Palæstina,
Judæa, Cœle<a id="FNanchor_3613" href="#Footnote_3613" class="fnanchor">3613</a>, and Phœnice. The country in the interior
was called Damascena, and that further on and more to the
south, Babylonia. The part that lies between the Euphrates<span class="pagenum" id="Page_424">424</span>
and the Tigris was called Mesopotamia, that beyond Taurus
Sophene, and that on this side of the same chain Comagene.
Beyond Armenia was the country of Adiabene, anciently
called Assyria, and at the part where it joins up to Cilicia,
it was called Antiochia. Its length, between Cilicia and
Arabia<a id="FNanchor_3614" href="#Footnote_3614" class="fnanchor">3614</a>, is 470 miles, and its breadth, from Seleucia Pieria<a id="FNanchor_3615" href="#Footnote_3615" class="fnanchor">3615</a> to
Zeugma<a id="FNanchor_3616" href="#Footnote_3616" class="fnanchor">3616</a>, a town on the Euphrates, 175. Those who make
a still more minute division of this country will have it that
Phœnice is surrounded by Syria, and that first comes the
maritime coast of Syria, part of which is Idumæa and Judæa,
after that Phœnice, and then Syria. The whole of the tract
of sea that lies in front of these shores is called the Phœnician
Sea. The Phœnician people enjoy the glory of having
been the inventors of letters<a id="FNanchor_3617" href="#Footnote_3617" class="fnanchor">3617</a>, and the first discoverers of the
sciences of astronomy, navigation, and the art of war.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_14">CHAP. 14.—IDUMÆA, PALÆSTINA, AND SAMARIA.</h3></div>

<p>On leaving Pelusium we come to the Camp of Chabrias<a id="FNanchor_3618" href="#Footnote_3618" class="fnanchor">3618</a>,
Mount Casius<a id="FNanchor_3619" href="#Footnote_3619" class="fnanchor">3619</a>, the temple of Jupiter Casius, and the
tomb of Pompeius Magnus. Ostracine<a id="FNanchor_3620" href="#Footnote_3620" class="fnanchor">3620</a>, at a distance of
sixty-five miles from Pelusium, is the frontier town of Arabia.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_425">425</span></p>

<p>(13.) After this, at the point where the Sirbonian
Lake<a id="FNanchor_3621" href="#Footnote_3621" class="fnanchor">3621</a> becomes visible, Idumæa and Palæstina begin. This
lake, which some writers have made to be 150 miles in circumference,
Herodotus has placed at the foot of Mount Casius;
it is now an inconsiderable fen. The towns are Rhinocolura<a id="FNanchor_3622" href="#Footnote_3622" class="fnanchor">3622</a>,
and, in the interior, Rhaphea<a id="FNanchor_3623" href="#Footnote_3623" class="fnanchor">3623</a>, Gaza, and, still more inland,
Anthedon<a id="FNanchor_3624" href="#Footnote_3624" class="fnanchor">3624</a>: there is also Mount Argaris<a id="FNanchor_3625" href="#Footnote_3625" class="fnanchor">3625</a>. Proceeding along
the coast we come to the region of Samaria; Ascalo<a id="FNanchor_3626" href="#Footnote_3626" class="fnanchor">3626</a>, a free
town, Azotus<a id="FNanchor_3627" href="#Footnote_3627" class="fnanchor">3627</a>, the two Jamniæ<a id="FNanchor_3628" href="#Footnote_3628" class="fnanchor">3628</a>, one of them in the interior;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_426">426</span>
and Joppe<a id="FNanchor_3629" href="#Footnote_3629" class="fnanchor">3629</a>, a city of the Phœnicians, which existed,
it is said, before the deluge of the earth. It is situate on
the slope of a hill, and in front of it lies a rock, upon which
they point out the vestiges of the chains by which Andromeda
was bound<a id="FNanchor_3630" href="#Footnote_3630" class="fnanchor">3630</a>. Here the fabulous goddess Ceto<a id="FNanchor_3631" href="#Footnote_3631" class="fnanchor">3631</a> is
worshipped. Next to this place comes Apollonia<a id="FNanchor_3632" href="#Footnote_3632" class="fnanchor">3632</a>, and
then the Tower of Strato<a id="FNanchor_3633" href="#Footnote_3633" class="fnanchor">3633</a>, otherwise Cæsarea, built by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_427">427</span>
King Herod, but now the Colony of Prima Flavia, established
by the Emperor Vespasianus: this place is the frontier
town of Palæstina, at a distance of 188 miles from the
confines of Arabia; after which comes Phœnice<a id="FNanchor_3634" href="#Footnote_3634" class="fnanchor">3634</a>. In the interior
of Samaria are the towns of Neapolis<a id="FNanchor_3635" href="#Footnote_3635" class="fnanchor">3635</a>, formerly called
Mamortha, Sebaste<a id="FNanchor_3636" href="#Footnote_3636" class="fnanchor">3636</a>, situate on a mountain, and, on a still
more lofty one, Gamala<a id="FNanchor_3637" href="#Footnote_3637" class="fnanchor">3637</a>.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_15">CHAP. 15. (14.)—JUDÆA.</h3></div>

<p>Beyond Idumæa and Samaria, Judæa extends far and
wide. That part of it which joins up to Syria<a id="FNanchor_3638" href="#Footnote_3638" class="fnanchor">3638</a> is called
Galilæa, while that which is nearest to Arabia and Egypt
bears the name of Peræa<a id="FNanchor_3639" href="#Footnote_3639" class="fnanchor">3639</a>. This last is thickly covered with
rugged mountains, and is separated from the rest of Judæa
by the river Jordanes. The remaining part of Judæa is
divided into ten Toparchies, which we will mention in the
following order:—That of Hiericus<a id="FNanchor_3640" href="#Footnote_3640" class="fnanchor">3640</a>, covered with groves of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_428">428</span>
palm-trees, and watered by numerous springs, and those of
Emmaüs<a id="FNanchor_3641" href="#Footnote_3641" class="fnanchor">3641</a>, Lydda<a id="FNanchor_3642" href="#Footnote_3642" class="fnanchor">3642</a>, Joppe, Acrabatena<a id="FNanchor_3643" href="#Footnote_3643" class="fnanchor">3643</a>, Gophna<a id="FNanchor_3644" href="#Footnote_3644" class="fnanchor">3644</a>, Thamna<a id="FNanchor_3645" href="#Footnote_3645" class="fnanchor">3645</a>,
Bethleptephene<a id="FNanchor_3646" href="#Footnote_3646" class="fnanchor">3646</a>, Orina<a id="FNanchor_3647" href="#Footnote_3647" class="fnanchor">3647</a>, in which formerly stood Hierosolyma<a id="FNanchor_3648" href="#Footnote_3648" class="fnanchor">3648</a>,
by far the most famous city, not of Judæa only,
but of the East, and Herodium<a id="FNanchor_3649" href="#Footnote_3649" class="fnanchor">3649</a>, with a celebrated town
of the same name.</p>

<p>(15.) The river Jordanes<a id="FNanchor_3650" href="#Footnote_3650" class="fnanchor">3650</a> rises from the spring of Panias<a id="FNanchor_3651" href="#Footnote_3651" class="fnanchor">3651</a>,
which has given its surname to Cæsarea, of which we shall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_429">429</span>
have occasion to speak<a id="FNanchor_3652" href="#Footnote_3652" class="fnanchor">3652</a>. This is a delightful stream, and,
so far as the situation of the localities will allow of, winds
along<a id="FNanchor_3653" href="#Footnote_3653" class="fnanchor">3653</a> in its course and lingers among the dwellers upon
its banks. With the greatest reluctance, as it were, it
moves onward towards Asphaltites<a id="FNanchor_3654" href="#Footnote_3654" class="fnanchor">3654</a>, a lake of a gloomy and
unpropitious nature, by which it is at last swallowed up,
and its bepraised waters are lost sight of on being mingled
with the pestilential streams of the lake. For this reason
it is that, as soon as ever the valleys through which it runs
afford it the opportunity, it discharges itself into a lake, by
many writers known as Genesara<a id="FNanchor_3655" href="#Footnote_3655" class="fnanchor">3655</a>, sixteen miles in length
and six wide; which is skirted by the pleasant towns of
Julias<a id="FNanchor_3656" href="#Footnote_3656" class="fnanchor">3656</a> and Hippo<a id="FNanchor_3657" href="#Footnote_3657" class="fnanchor">3657</a> on the east, of Tarichea<a id="FNanchor_3658" href="#Footnote_3658" class="fnanchor">3658</a> on the south
(a name which is by many persons given to the lake itself),
and of Tiberias<a id="FNanchor_3659" href="#Footnote_3659" class="fnanchor">3659</a> on the west, the hot springs<a id="FNanchor_3660" href="#Footnote_3660" class="fnanchor">3660</a> of which are
so conducive to the restoration of health.</p>

<p>(16.) Asphaltites<a id="FNanchor_3661" href="#Footnote_3661" class="fnanchor">3661</a> produces nothing whatever except bitumen,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_430">430</span>
to which indeed it owes its name. The bodies of
animals will not sink<a id="FNanchor_3662" href="#Footnote_3662" class="fnanchor">3662</a> in its waters, and even those of bulls
and camels float there. In length it exceeds 100 miles
being at its greatest breadth twenty-five, and at its smallest
six. Arabia of the Nomades<a id="FNanchor_3663" href="#Footnote_3663" class="fnanchor">3663</a> faces it on the east, and
Machærus on the south<a id="FNanchor_3664" href="#Footnote_3664" class="fnanchor">3664</a>, at one time, next to Hierosolyma,
the most strongly fortified place in Judæa. On the same
side lies Callirrhoë<a id="FNanchor_3665" href="#Footnote_3665" class="fnanchor">3665</a>, a warm spring, remarkable for its medicinal
qualities, and which, by its name, indicates the celebrity
its waters have gained.</p>

<p>(17.) Lying on the west of Asphaltites, and sufficiently
distant to escape its noxious exhalations, are the Esseni<a id="FNanchor_3666" href="#Footnote_3666" class="fnanchor">3666</a>, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_431">431</span>
people that live apart from the world, and marvellous beyond
all others throughout the whole earth, for they have no women
among them; to sexual desire they are strangers; money
they have none; the palm-trees are their only companions.
Day after day, however, their numbers are fully recruited by
multitudes of strangers that resort to them, driven thither
to adopt their usages by the tempests of fortune, and wearied
with the miseries of life. Thus it is, that through thousands
of ages, incredible to relate, this people eternally prolongs
its existence, without a single birth taking place there; so
fruitful a source of population to it is that weariness of
life which is felt by others. Below this people was formerly
the town of Engadda<a id="FNanchor_3667" href="#Footnote_3667" class="fnanchor">3667</a>, second only to Hierosolyma in
the fertility of its soil and its groves of palm-trees; now,
like it, it is another heap of ashes. Next to it we come to
Masada<a id="FNanchor_3668" href="#Footnote_3668" class="fnanchor">3668</a>, a fortress on a rock, not far from Lake Asphaltites.
Thus much concerning Judæa.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_16">CHAP. 16. (18.)—DECAPOLIS.</h3></div>

<p>On the side of Syria, joining up to Judæa, is the region
of Decapolis<a id="FNanchor_3669" href="#Footnote_3669" class="fnanchor">3669</a>, so called from the number of its cities; as to
which all writers are not agreed. Most of them, however,
agree in speaking of Damascus<a id="FNanchor_3670" href="#Footnote_3670" class="fnanchor">3670</a> as one, a place fertilized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_432">432</span>
by the river Chrysorroös<a id="FNanchor_3671" href="#Footnote_3671" class="fnanchor">3671</a>, which is drawn off into its
meadows and eagerly imbibed; Philadelphia<a id="FNanchor_3672" href="#Footnote_3672" class="fnanchor">3672</a>, and Rhaphana<a id="FNanchor_3673" href="#Footnote_3673" class="fnanchor">3673</a>,
all which cities fall back towards Arabia; Scythopolis<a id="FNanchor_3674" href="#Footnote_3674" class="fnanchor">3674</a>
(formerly called Nysa by Father Liber, from his
nurse having been buried there), its present name being
derived from a Scythian colony which was established
there; Gadara<a id="FNanchor_3675" href="#Footnote_3675" class="fnanchor">3675</a>, before which the river Hieromix<a id="FNanchor_3676" href="#Footnote_3676" class="fnanchor">3676</a> flows;
Hippo, which has been previously mentioned; Dion<a id="FNanchor_3677" href="#Footnote_3677" class="fnanchor">3677</a>, Pella<a id="FNanchor_3678" href="#Footnote_3678" class="fnanchor">3678</a>,
rich with its waters; Galasa<a id="FNanchor_3679" href="#Footnote_3679" class="fnanchor">3679</a>, and Canatha<a id="FNanchor_3680" href="#Footnote_3680" class="fnanchor">3680</a>. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_433">433</span>
Tetrarchies<a id="FNanchor_3681" href="#Footnote_3681" class="fnanchor">3681</a> lie between and around these cities, equal, each of
them, to a kingdom, and occupying the same rank as so
many kingdoms. Their names are, Trachonitis<a id="FNanchor_3682" href="#Footnote_3682" class="fnanchor">3682</a>, Panias<a id="FNanchor_3683" href="#Footnote_3683" class="fnanchor">3683</a>,
in which is Cæsarea, with the spring previously mentioned<a id="FNanchor_3684" href="#Footnote_3684" class="fnanchor">3684</a>,

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_17">CHAP. 17. (19.)—PHŒNICE.</h3></div>

<p>We must now return to the coast and to Phœnice. There
was formerly a town here known as Crocodilon; there is still
a river<a id="FNanchor_3689" href="#Footnote_3689" class="fnanchor">3689</a> of that name: Dorum<a id="FNanchor_3690" href="#Footnote_3690" class="fnanchor">3690</a> and Sycaminon<a id="FNanchor_3691" href="#Footnote_3691" class="fnanchor">3691</a> are the names<span class="pagenum" id="Page_434">434</span>
of cities of which the remembrance only exists. We then
come to the Promontory of Carmelus<a id="FNanchor_3692" href="#Footnote_3692" class="fnanchor">3692</a>, and, upon the mountain,
a town<a id="FNanchor_3693" href="#Footnote_3693" class="fnanchor">3693</a> of that name, formerly called Acbatana. Next
to this are Getta<a id="FNanchor_3694" href="#Footnote_3694" class="fnanchor">3694</a>, Jeba, and the river Pacida, or Belus<a id="FNanchor_3695" href="#Footnote_3695" class="fnanchor">3695</a>,
which throws up on its narrow banks a kind of sand from
which glass<a id="FNanchor_3696" href="#Footnote_3696" class="fnanchor">3696</a> is made: this river flows from the marshes of
Cendebia, at the foot of Mount Carmelus. Close to this
river is Ptolemais, formerly called Ace<a id="FNanchor_3697" href="#Footnote_3697" class="fnanchor">3697</a>, a colony of Claudius
Cæsar; and then the town of Ecdippa<a id="FNanchor_3698" href="#Footnote_3698" class="fnanchor">3698</a>, and the promontory
known as the White Promontory<a id="FNanchor_3699" href="#Footnote_3699" class="fnanchor">3699</a>. We next come
to the city of Tyre<a id="FNanchor_3700" href="#Footnote_3700" class="fnanchor">3700</a>, formerly an island, separated from
the mainland by a channel of the sea, of great depth, 700
paces in width, but now joined to it by the works which
were thrown up by Alexander when besieging it,—the
Tyre so famous in ancient times for its offspring, the cities
to which it gave birth, Leptis, Utica, and Carthage<a id="FNanchor_3701" href="#Footnote_3701" class="fnanchor">3701</a>,—that
rival of the Roman sway, that thirsted so eagerly for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_435">435</span>
conquest of the whole earth; Gades, too, which she founded
beyond the limits of the world. At the present day, all her
fame is confined to the production of the murex and the
purple<a id="FNanchor_3702" href="#Footnote_3702" class="fnanchor">3702</a>. Its circumference, including therein Palætyrus<a id="FNanchor_3703" href="#Footnote_3703" class="fnanchor">3703</a>, is
nineteen miles, the place itself extending twenty-two stadia.
The next towns are Sarepta<a id="FNanchor_3704" href="#Footnote_3704" class="fnanchor">3704</a> and Ornithon<a id="FNanchor_3705" href="#Footnote_3705" class="fnanchor">3705</a>, and then
Sidon<a id="FNanchor_3706" href="#Footnote_3706" class="fnanchor">3706</a>, famous for its manufacture of glass, and the parent
of Thebes<a id="FNanchor_3707" href="#Footnote_3707" class="fnanchor">3707</a> in Bœotia.</p>

<p>(20.) In the rear of this spot begins the chain of Libanus,
which extends 1500 stadia, as far as Simyra; this district
has the name of Cœle Syria. Opposite to this chain, and
separated from it by an intervening valley, stretches away
the range of Antilibanus, which was formerly connected
with Libanus<a id="FNanchor_3708" href="#Footnote_3708" class="fnanchor">3708</a> by a wall. Beyond it, and lying in the interior,
is the region of Decapolis, and, with it, the Tetrarchies
already mentioned, and the whole expanse of Palæstina. On
the coast, again, and lying beneath Libanus, is the river
Magoras<a id="FNanchor_3709" href="#Footnote_3709" class="fnanchor">3709</a>, the colony of Berytus<a id="FNanchor_3710" href="#Footnote_3710" class="fnanchor">3710</a>, which bears the name of
Felix Julia, the town of Leontos<a id="FNanchor_3711" href="#Footnote_3711" class="fnanchor">3711</a>, the river Lycos<a id="FNanchor_3712" href="#Footnote_3712" class="fnanchor">3712</a>, Palæbyblos<a id="FNanchor_3713" href="#Footnote_3713" class="fnanchor">3713</a>,
the river Adonis<a id="FNanchor_3714" href="#Footnote_3714" class="fnanchor">3714</a>, and the towns of Byblos<a id="FNanchor_3715" href="#Footnote_3715" class="fnanchor">3715</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_436">436</span>
Botrys<a id="FNanchor_3716" href="#Footnote_3716" class="fnanchor">3716</a>, Gigarta<a id="FNanchor_3717" href="#Footnote_3717" class="fnanchor">3717</a>, Trieris<a id="FNanchor_3718" href="#Footnote_3718" class="fnanchor">3718</a>, Calamos<a id="FNanchor_3719" href="#Footnote_3719" class="fnanchor">3719</a>, Tripolis<a id="FNanchor_3720" href="#Footnote_3720" class="fnanchor">3720</a>, inhabited
by the Tyrians, Sidonians, and Aradians; Orthosia<a id="FNanchor_3721" href="#Footnote_3721" class="fnanchor">3721</a>, the
river Eleutheros<a id="FNanchor_3722" href="#Footnote_3722" class="fnanchor">3722</a>, the towns of Simyra and Marathos<a id="FNanchor_3723" href="#Footnote_3723" class="fnanchor">3723</a>; and
opposite, Arados<a id="FNanchor_3724" href="#Footnote_3724" class="fnanchor">3724</a>, a town seven stadia long, on an island,
distant 200 paces from the mainland. After passing
through the country in which the before-named mountains
end and the plains that lie between, Mount Bargylus<a id="FNanchor_3725" href="#Footnote_3725" class="fnanchor">3725</a>
is seen to rise.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_18">CHAP. 18.—SYRIA ANTIOCHIA.</h3></div>

<p>Here Phœnicia ends, and Syria recommences. The towns<span class="pagenum" id="Page_437">437</span>
are, Carne<a id="FNanchor_3726" href="#Footnote_3726" class="fnanchor">3726</a>, Balanea<a id="FNanchor_3727" href="#Footnote_3727" class="fnanchor">3727</a>, Paltos<a id="FNanchor_3728" href="#Footnote_3728" class="fnanchor">3728</a>, and Gabale<a id="FNanchor_3729" href="#Footnote_3729" class="fnanchor">3729</a>; then the promontory
upon which is situate the free town of Laodicea<a id="FNanchor_3730" href="#Footnote_3730" class="fnanchor">3730</a>;
and then Diospolis<a id="FNanchor_3731" href="#Footnote_3731" class="fnanchor">3731</a>, Heraclea<a id="FNanchor_3732" href="#Footnote_3732" class="fnanchor">3732</a>, Charadrus<a id="FNanchor_3733" href="#Footnote_3733" class="fnanchor">3733</a>, and Posidium<a id="FNanchor_3734" href="#Footnote_3734" class="fnanchor">3734</a>.</p>

<p>(21.) We then come to the Promontory of Syria Antiochia.
In the interior is the free city of Antiochia<a id="FNanchor_3735" href="#Footnote_3735" class="fnanchor">3735</a> itself,
surnamed Epidaphnes<a id="FNanchor_3736" href="#Footnote_3736" class="fnanchor">3736</a>, and divided by the river Orontes<a id="FNanchor_3737" href="#Footnote_3737" class="fnanchor">3737</a>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_438">438</span>
On the promontory is Seleucia<a id="FNanchor_3738" href="#Footnote_3738" class="fnanchor">3738</a>, called Pieria, a free city.</p>

<p>(22.) Beyond it lies Mount Casius<a id="FNanchor_3739" href="#Footnote_3739" class="fnanchor">3739</a>, a different one from the
mountain of the same name<a id="FNanchor_3740" href="#Footnote_3740" class="fnanchor">3740</a> which we have already mentioned.
The height of this mountain is so vast, that, at the fourth
watch<a id="FNanchor_3741" href="#Footnote_3741" class="fnanchor">3741</a> of the night, you can see from it, in the midst of the
darkness, the sun rising on the east; and thus, by merely
turning round, we may at one and the same time behold both
day and night. The winding road which leads to its summit
is nineteen miles in length, its perpendicular height four.
Upon this coast there is the river Orontes, which takes its
rise near Heliopolis<a id="FNanchor_3742" href="#Footnote_3742" class="fnanchor">3742</a>, between the range of Libanus and Antilibanus.
The towns are, Rhosos<a id="FNanchor_3743" href="#Footnote_3743" class="fnanchor">3743</a>, and, behind it, the Gates
of Syria<a id="FNanchor_3744" href="#Footnote_3744" class="fnanchor">3744</a>, lying in the space between the chain of the Rhosian
mountains and that of Taurus. On the coast there is the
town of Myriandros<a id="FNanchor_3745" href="#Footnote_3745" class="fnanchor">3745</a>, and Mount Amanus<a id="FNanchor_3746" href="#Footnote_3746" class="fnanchor">3746</a>, upon which is the
town of Bomitæ<a id="FNanchor_3747" href="#Footnote_3747" class="fnanchor">3747</a>. This mountain separates Cilicia from Syria.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_19">CHAP. 19. (23.)—THE REMAINING PARTS OF SYRIA.</h3></div>

<p>We must now speak of the interior of Syria. Cœle Syria<span class="pagenum" id="Page_439">439</span>
has the town of Apamea<a id="FNanchor_3748" href="#Footnote_3748" class="fnanchor">3748</a>, divided by the river Marsyas from
the Tetrarchy of the Nazerini<a id="FNanchor_3749" href="#Footnote_3749" class="fnanchor">3749</a>; Bambyx, the other name of
which is Hierapolis<a id="FNanchor_3750" href="#Footnote_3750" class="fnanchor">3750</a>, but by the Syrians called Mabog<a id="FNanchor_3751" href="#Footnote_3751" class="fnanchor">3751</a>,
(here the monster Atargatis<a id="FNanchor_3752" href="#Footnote_3752" class="fnanchor">3752</a>, called Derceto by the Greeks,
is worshipped); and the place called Chalcis<a id="FNanchor_3753" href="#Footnote_3753" class="fnanchor">3753</a> on the Belus<a id="FNanchor_3754" href="#Footnote_3754" class="fnanchor">3754</a>,
from which the region of Chalcidene, the most fertile part of
Syria, takes its name. We here find also Cyrrhestice, with
Cyrrhum<a id="FNanchor_3755" href="#Footnote_3755" class="fnanchor">3755</a>, the Gazatæ, the Gindareni, the Gabeni, the two
Tetrarchies called Granucomatæ<a id="FNanchor_3756" href="#Footnote_3756" class="fnanchor">3756</a>, the Emeseni<a id="FNanchor_3757" href="#Footnote_3757" class="fnanchor">3757</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_440">440</span>
Hylatæ<a id="FNanchor_3758" href="#Footnote_3758" class="fnanchor">3758</a>, the nation of the Ituræi, and a branch of them, the
people called the Bætarreni; the Mariamitani<a id="FNanchor_3759" href="#Footnote_3759" class="fnanchor">3759</a>, the Tetrarchy
known as Mammisea, Paradisus<a id="FNanchor_3760" href="#Footnote_3760" class="fnanchor">3760</a>, Pagræ<a id="FNanchor_3761" href="#Footnote_3761" class="fnanchor">3761</a>, the
Pinaritæ<a id="FNanchor_3762" href="#Footnote_3762" class="fnanchor">3762</a>, two cities called Seleucia, besides the one already
mentioned, the one Seleucia on the Euphrates<a id="FNanchor_3763" href="#Footnote_3763" class="fnanchor">3763</a>, and
the other Seleucia<a id="FNanchor_3764" href="#Footnote_3764" class="fnanchor">3764</a> on the Belus, and the Cardytenses.
The remaining part of Syria (except those parts which will
be spoken of in conjunction with the Euphrates) contains
the Arethusii<a id="FNanchor_3765" href="#Footnote_3765" class="fnanchor">3765</a>, the Berœenses<a id="FNanchor_3766" href="#Footnote_3766" class="fnanchor">3766</a>, and the Epiphanæenses<a id="FNanchor_3767" href="#Footnote_3767" class="fnanchor">3767</a>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_441">441</span>
and on the east, the Laodiceni<a id="FNanchor_3768" href="#Footnote_3768" class="fnanchor">3768</a>, who are called the Laodiceni
on the Libanus, the Leucadii<a id="FNanchor_3769" href="#Footnote_3769" class="fnanchor">3769</a>, and the Larissæi, besides
seventeen other Tetrarchies, divided into kingdoms and
bearing barbarous names.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_20">CHAP. 20. (24.)—THE EUPHRATES.</h3></div>

<p>This place, too, will be the most appropriate one for
making some mention of the Euphrates. This river rises in
Caranitis<a id="FNanchor_3770" href="#Footnote_3770" class="fnanchor">3770</a>, a præfecture of Greater Armenia, according to
the statement of those who have approached the nearest to
its source. Domitius Corbulo says, that it rises in Mount
Aba; Licinius Mucianus, at the foot of a mountain which
he calls Capotes<a id="FNanchor_3771" href="#Footnote_3771" class="fnanchor">3771</a>, twelve miles above Zimara, and that at its
source it has the name of Pyxurates. It first flows past
Derxene<a id="FNanchor_3772" href="#Footnote_3772" class="fnanchor">3772</a>, and then Anaitica<a id="FNanchor_3773" href="#Footnote_3773" class="fnanchor">3773</a>, shutting out<a id="FNanchor_3774" href="#Footnote_3774" class="fnanchor">3774</a> the regions of
Armenia from Cappadocia. Dascusa<a id="FNanchor_3775" href="#Footnote_3775" class="fnanchor">3775</a> is distant from Zimara
seventy-five miles; from this spot it is navigable as far as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_442">442</span>
Sartona<a id="FNanchor_3776" href="#Footnote_3776" class="fnanchor">3776</a>, a distance of fifty miles, thence to Melitene<a id="FNanchor_3777" href="#Footnote_3777" class="fnanchor">3777</a>, in
Cappadocia, distant seventy-four<a id="FNanchor_3778" href="#Footnote_3778" class="fnanchor">3778</a> miles, and thence to Elegia<a id="FNanchor_3779" href="#Footnote_3779" class="fnanchor">3779</a>,
in Armenia, distant ten miles; receiving in its course the
rivers Lycus<a id="FNanchor_3780" href="#Footnote_3780" class="fnanchor">3780</a>, Arsanias<a id="FNanchor_3781" href="#Footnote_3781" class="fnanchor">3781</a>, and Arsanus. At Elegia it meets
the range of Mount Taurus, but no effectual resistance is
offered to its course, although the chain is here twelve
miles in width. At its passage<a id="FNanchor_3782" href="#Footnote_3782" class="fnanchor">3782</a> between the mountains,
the river bears the name of Omma<a id="FNanchor_3783" href="#Footnote_3783" class="fnanchor">3783</a>; but afterwards, when it
has passed through, it receives that of Euphrates. Beyond
this spot it is full of rocks, and runs with an impetuous
tide. It then divides that part of Arabia which is called
the country of the Orei<a id="FNanchor_3784" href="#Footnote_3784" class="fnanchor">3784</a>, on the left, by a channel three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_443">443</span>
schœni<a id="FNanchor_3785" href="#Footnote_3785" class="fnanchor">3785</a> in width, from the territory of the Commageni<a id="FNanchor_3786" href="#Footnote_3786" class="fnanchor">3786</a> on
the right, and it admits of a bridge being thrown across it,
even where it forces a passage through the range of Taurus.
At Claudiopolis<a id="FNanchor_3787" href="#Footnote_3787" class="fnanchor">3787</a>, in Cappadocia, it takes an easterly direction;
and here, for the first time in this contest, Taurus
turns it out of its course; though conquered before, and
rent asunder by its channel, the mountain-chain now gains
the victory in another way, and, breaking its career, compels
it to take a southerly direction. Thus is this warfare
of nature equally waged,—the river proceeding onward to
the destination which it intends to reach, and the mountains
forbidding it to proceed by the path which it originally
intended. After passing the Cataracts<a id="FNanchor_3788" href="#Footnote_3788" class="fnanchor">3788</a>, the river again
becomes navigable; and, at a distance of forty miles from
thence, is Samosata<a id="FNanchor_3789" href="#Footnote_3789" class="fnanchor">3789</a>, the capital of Commagene.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_21">CHAP. 21.—SYRIA UPON THE EUPHRATES.</h3></div>

<p>Arabia, above mentioned, has the cities of Edessa<a id="FNanchor_3790" href="#Footnote_3790" class="fnanchor">3790</a>, formerly
called Antiochia, and, from the name of its fountain,
Callirhoë<a id="FNanchor_3791" href="#Footnote_3791" class="fnanchor">3791</a>, and Carrhæ<a id="FNanchor_3792" href="#Footnote_3792" class="fnanchor">3792</a>, memorable for the defeat of Crassus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_444">444</span>
there. Adjoining to this is the præfecture of Mesopotamia,
which derives its origin from the Assyrians, and in which are
the towns of Anthemusia<a id="FNanchor_3793" href="#Footnote_3793" class="fnanchor">3793</a> and Nicephorium<a id="FNanchor_3794" href="#Footnote_3794" class="fnanchor">3794</a>; after which
come the Arabians, known by the name of Prætavi, with Singara<a id="FNanchor_3795" href="#Footnote_3795" class="fnanchor">3795</a>
for their capital. Below Samosata, on the side of Syria,
the river Marsyas<a id="FNanchor_3796" href="#Footnote_3796" class="fnanchor">3796</a> flows into the Euphrates. At Cingilla
ends the territory of Commagene, and the state of the
Immei begins. The cities which are here washed by the
river are those of Epiphania<a id="FNanchor_3797" href="#Footnote_3797" class="fnanchor">3797</a> and Antiochia<a id="FNanchor_3798" href="#Footnote_3798" class="fnanchor">3798</a>, generally
known as Epiphania and Antiochia on the Euphrates; also
Zeugma, seventy-two miles distant from Samosata, famous
for the passage there across the Euphrates. Opposite
to it is Apamia<a id="FNanchor_3799" href="#Footnote_3799" class="fnanchor">3799</a>, which Seleucus, the founder of both
cities, united by a bridge. The people who join up to
Mesopotamia are called the Rhoali. Other towns in Syria
are those of Europus<a id="FNanchor_3800" href="#Footnote_3800" class="fnanchor">3800</a>, and what was formerly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_445">445</span>
Thapsacus<a id="FNanchor_3801" href="#Footnote_3801" class="fnanchor">3801</a>, now Amphipolis. We then come to the Arabian
Scenitæ<a id="FNanchor_3802" href="#Footnote_3802" class="fnanchor">3802</a>. The Euphrates then proceeds in its course till
it reaches the place called Ura<a id="FNanchor_3803" href="#Footnote_3803" class="fnanchor">3803</a>, at which, taking a turn
to the east, it leaves the Syrian Deserts of Palmyra<a id="FNanchor_3804" href="#Footnote_3804" class="fnanchor">3804</a>,
which extend as far as the city of Petra<a id="FNanchor_3805" href="#Footnote_3805" class="fnanchor">3805</a> and the regions
of Arabia Felix.</p>

<p>(25.) Palmyra is a city famous for the beauty of its site,
the riches of its soil, and the delicious quality and abundance
of its water. Its fields are surrounded by sands on every
side, and are thus separated, as it were, by nature from the rest
of the world. Though placed between the two great empires
of Rome and Parthia, it still maintains<a id="FNanchor_3806" href="#Footnote_3806" class="fnanchor">3806</a> its independence;
never failing, at the very first moment that a rupture
between them is threatened, to attract the careful attention
of both. It is distant 337 miles from Seleucia<a id="FNanchor_3807" href="#Footnote_3807" class="fnanchor">3807</a> of the
Parthians, generally known as Seleucia on the Tigris, 203
from the nearest part of the Syrian coast, and twenty-seven
less from Damascus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_446">446</span></p>

<p>(26.) Below the deserts of Palmyra is the region of
Stelendene<a id="FNanchor_3808" href="#Footnote_3808" class="fnanchor">3808</a>, and Hierapolis, Berœa, and Chalcis, already
mentioned<a id="FNanchor_3809" href="#Footnote_3809" class="fnanchor">3809</a>. Beyond Palmyra, Emesa<a id="FNanchor_3810" href="#Footnote_3810" class="fnanchor">3810</a> takes to itself a
portion of these deserts; also Elatium, nearer to Petra by
one-half than Damascus. At no great distance from Sura<a id="FNanchor_3811" href="#Footnote_3811" class="fnanchor">3811</a>
is Philiscum, a town of the Parthians, on the Euphrates.
From this place it is ten days’ sail to Seleucia, and nearly
as many to Babylon. At a distance of 594 miles beyond
Zeugma, near the village of Massice, the Euphrates
divides into two channels, the left one of which runs through
Mesopotamia, past Seleucia, and falls into the Tigris as it
flows around that city. Its channel on the right runs towards
Babylon, the former capital of Chaldæa, and flows through
the middle of it; and then through another city, the name of
which is Otris<a id="FNanchor_3812" href="#Footnote_3812" class="fnanchor">3812</a>, after which it becomes lost in the marshes.
Like the Nile, this river increases at stated times, and at
much about the same period. When the sun has reached
the twentieth degree of Cancer, it inundates<a id="FNanchor_3813" href="#Footnote_3813" class="fnanchor">3813</a> Mesopotamia;
and, after he has passed through Leo and entered Virgo,
its waters begin to subside. By the time the sun has
entered the twenty-ninth degree of Virgo, the river has fully
regained its usual height.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_22">CHAP. 22. (27.)—CILICIA AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.</h3></div>

<p>But let us now return to the coast of Syria, joining up
to which is Cilicia. We here find the river Diaphanes<a id="FNanchor_3814" href="#Footnote_3814" class="fnanchor">3814</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_447">447</span>
Mount Crocodilus, the Gates<a id="FNanchor_3815" href="#Footnote_3815" class="fnanchor">3815</a> of Mount Amanus, the rivers
Androcus<a id="FNanchor_3816" href="#Footnote_3816" class="fnanchor">3816</a>, Pinarus<a id="FNanchor_3817" href="#Footnote_3817" class="fnanchor">3817</a>, and Lycus<a id="FNanchor_3818" href="#Footnote_3818" class="fnanchor">3818</a>, the Gulf of Issos<a id="FNanchor_3819" href="#Footnote_3819" class="fnanchor">3819</a>, and the
town of that name; then Alexandria<a id="FNanchor_3820" href="#Footnote_3820" class="fnanchor">3820</a>, the river Chlorus<a id="FNanchor_3821" href="#Footnote_3821" class="fnanchor">3821</a>,
the free town of Ægæ<a id="FNanchor_3822" href="#Footnote_3822" class="fnanchor">3822</a>, the river Pyramus<a id="FNanchor_3823" href="#Footnote_3823" class="fnanchor">3823</a>, the Gates<a id="FNanchor_3824" href="#Footnote_3824" class="fnanchor">3824</a> of
Cilicia, the towns of Mallos<a id="FNanchor_3825" href="#Footnote_3825" class="fnanchor">3825</a> and Magarsos<a id="FNanchor_3826" href="#Footnote_3826" class="fnanchor">3826</a>, and, in the
interior, Tarsus<a id="FNanchor_3827" href="#Footnote_3827" class="fnanchor">3827</a>. We then come to the Aleian Plains<a id="FNanchor_3828" href="#Footnote_3828" class="fnanchor">3828</a>, the
town of Cassipolis, Mopsos<a id="FNanchor_3829" href="#Footnote_3829" class="fnanchor">3829</a>, a free town on the river Pyramus,
Thynos, Zephyrium, and Anchiale<a id="FNanchor_3830" href="#Footnote_3830" class="fnanchor">3830</a>. Next to these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_448">448</span>
are the rivers Saros<a id="FNanchor_3831" href="#Footnote_3831" class="fnanchor">3831</a> and Cydnus<a id="FNanchor_3832" href="#Footnote_3832" class="fnanchor">3832</a>, the latter of which, at
some distance from the sea, runs through the free city of
Tarsus, the region of Celenderitis with a town<a id="FNanchor_3833" href="#Footnote_3833" class="fnanchor">3833</a> of similar
name, the place where Nymphæum<a id="FNanchor_3834" href="#Footnote_3834" class="fnanchor">3834</a> stood, Soli of Cilicia<a id="FNanchor_3835" href="#Footnote_3835" class="fnanchor">3835</a>,
now called Pompeiopolis, Adana<a id="FNanchor_3836" href="#Footnote_3836" class="fnanchor">3836</a>, Cibyra<a id="FNanchor_3837" href="#Footnote_3837" class="fnanchor">3837</a>, Pinare<a id="FNanchor_3838" href="#Footnote_3838" class="fnanchor">3838</a>, Pedalie<a id="FNanchor_3839" href="#Footnote_3839" class="fnanchor">3839</a>,
Ale, Selinus<a id="FNanchor_3840" href="#Footnote_3840" class="fnanchor">3840</a>, Arsinoë<a id="FNanchor_3841" href="#Footnote_3841" class="fnanchor">3841</a>, Iotape<a id="FNanchor_3842" href="#Footnote_3842" class="fnanchor">3842</a>, Doron, and, near the sea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_449">449</span>
Corycos, there being a town<a id="FNanchor_3843" href="#Footnote_3843" class="fnanchor">3843</a>, port, and cave<a id="FNanchor_3844" href="#Footnote_3844" class="fnanchor">3844</a> all of the same
name. Passing these, we come to the river Calycadnus<a id="FNanchor_3845" href="#Footnote_3845" class="fnanchor">3845</a>,
the Promontory of Sarpedon<a id="FNanchor_3846" href="#Footnote_3846" class="fnanchor">3846</a>, the towns of Holmœ<a id="FNanchor_3847" href="#Footnote_3847" class="fnanchor">3847</a> and
Myle, and the Promontory and town of Venus<a id="FNanchor_3848" href="#Footnote_3848" class="fnanchor">3848</a>, at a short
distance from the island of Cyprus. On the mainland there
are the towns of Myanda, Anemurium<a id="FNanchor_3849" href="#Footnote_3849" class="fnanchor">3849</a>, and Coracesium<a id="FNanchor_3850" href="#Footnote_3850" class="fnanchor">3850</a>,
and the river Melas<a id="FNanchor_3851" href="#Footnote_3851" class="fnanchor">3851</a>, the ancient boundary of Cilicia. In
the interior the places more especially worthy of mention
are Anazarbus<a id="FNanchor_3852" href="#Footnote_3852" class="fnanchor">3852</a>, now called Cæsarea, Augusta, Castabala<a id="FNanchor_3853" href="#Footnote_3853" class="fnanchor">3853</a>,
Epiphania<a id="FNanchor_3854" href="#Footnote_3854" class="fnanchor">3854</a>, formerly called Œniandos, Eleusa<a id="FNanchor_3855" href="#Footnote_3855" class="fnanchor">3855</a>, Iconium<a id="FNanchor_3856" href="#Footnote_3856" class="fnanchor">3856</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_450">450</span>
Seleucia<a id="FNanchor_3857" href="#Footnote_3857" class="fnanchor">3857</a> upon the river Calycadnus, surnamed Tracheotis,
a city removed<a id="FNanchor_3858" href="#Footnote_3858" class="fnanchor">3858</a> from the sea-shore, where it had the name of
Holmia. Besides those already mentioned, there are in the
interior the rivers Liparis<a id="FNanchor_3859" href="#Footnote_3859" class="fnanchor">3859</a>, Bombos, Paradisus, and Mount
Imbarus<a id="FNanchor_3860" href="#Footnote_3860" class="fnanchor">3860</a>.</p>

<p>All the geographers have mentioned Pamphylia as joining
up to Cilicia, without taking any notice of the people of
Isauria<a id="FNanchor_3861" href="#Footnote_3861" class="fnanchor">3861</a>. Its cities are, in the interior, Isaura<a id="FNanchor_3862" href="#Footnote_3862" class="fnanchor">3862</a>, Clibanus,
and Lalasis; it runs down towards the sea by the side of
Anemurium<a id="FNanchor_3863" href="#Footnote_3863" class="fnanchor">3863</a> already mentioned. In a similar manner also,
all who have treated of this subject have been ignorant of
the existence of the nation of the Homonades bordering upon
Isauria, and their town of Homona<a id="FNanchor_3864" href="#Footnote_3864" class="fnanchor">3864</a> in the interior. There
are forty-four other fortresses, which lie concealed amid
rugged crags and valleys.</p>

<p>The Pisidæ<a id="FNanchor_3865" href="#Footnote_3865" class="fnanchor">3865</a>, formerly called the Solymi, occupy the higher
parts of the mountains. In their country there is the colony
of Cæsarea, also called Antiochia<a id="FNanchor_3866" href="#Footnote_3866" class="fnanchor">3866</a>, and the towns of Oroanda<a id="FNanchor_3867" href="#Footnote_3867" class="fnanchor">3867</a>
and Sagalessos.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_25">CHAP. 25.—LYCAONIA.</h3></div>

<p>These people are bounded by Lycaonia<a id="FNanchor_3868" href="#Footnote_3868" class="fnanchor">3868</a>, which belongs to
the jurisdiction of the province of Asia<a id="FNanchor_3869" href="#Footnote_3869" class="fnanchor">3869</a>, to which also resort

Pelta, and Tyrium. To this jurisdiction is also added a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_452">452</span>
Tetrarchy of Lycaonia in that part which joins up to Galatia,
containing fourteen states, with the famous city of Iconium<a id="FNanchor_3873" href="#Footnote_3873" class="fnanchor">3873</a>.
In Lycaonia itself the most noted places are Thebasa<a id="FNanchor_3874" href="#Footnote_3874" class="fnanchor">3874</a> on
Taurus, and Hyde, on the confines of Galatia and Cappadocia.
On the [western] side of Lycaonia, and above Pamphylia,
come the Milyæ<a id="FNanchor_3875" href="#Footnote_3875" class="fnanchor">3875</a>, a people descended from the
Thracians; their city is Arycanda.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_26">CHAP. 26.—PAMPHYLIA.</h3></div>

<p>The former name of Pamphylia<a id="FNanchor_3876" href="#Footnote_3876" class="fnanchor">3876</a> was Mopsopia<a id="FNanchor_3877" href="#Footnote_3877" class="fnanchor">3877</a>. The
Pamphylian Sea<a id="FNanchor_3878" href="#Footnote_3878" class="fnanchor">3878</a> joins up to that of Cilicia. The towns of
Pamphylia are Side<a id="FNanchor_3879" href="#Footnote_3879" class="fnanchor">3879</a>, Aspendum<a id="FNanchor_3880" href="#Footnote_3880" class="fnanchor">3880</a>, situate on the side of a
mountain, Pletenissum<a id="FNanchor_3881" href="#Footnote_3881" class="fnanchor">3881</a>, and Perga<a id="FNanchor_3882" href="#Footnote_3882" class="fnanchor">3882</a>. There is also the Promontory
of Leucolla, the mountain of Sardemisus, and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_453">453</span>
rivers Eurymedon<a id="FNanchor_3883" href="#Footnote_3883" class="fnanchor">3883</a>, which flows past Aspendus, and Catarrhactes<a id="FNanchor_3884" href="#Footnote_3884" class="fnanchor">3884</a>,
near to which is Lyrnesus: also the towns of
Olbia<a id="FNanchor_3885" href="#Footnote_3885" class="fnanchor">3885</a>, and Phaselis<a id="FNanchor_3886" href="#Footnote_3886" class="fnanchor">3886</a>, the last on this coast.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_27">CHAP. 27.—MOUNT TAURUS.</h3></div>

<p>Adjoining to Pamphylia is the Sea of Lycia and the country
of Lycia<a id="FNanchor_3887" href="#Footnote_3887" class="fnanchor">3887</a> itself, where the chain of Taurus, coming from
the eastern shores, terminates the vast Gulf<a id="FNanchor_3888" href="#Footnote_3888" class="fnanchor">3888</a> by the Promontory
of Chelidonium<a id="FNanchor_3889" href="#Footnote_3889" class="fnanchor">3889</a>. Of immense extent, and separating
nations innumerable, after taking its first rise at the Indian
Sea<a id="FNanchor_3890" href="#Footnote_3890" class="fnanchor">3890</a>, it branches off to the north on the right-hand side,
and on the left towards the south. Then taking a direction
towards the west, it would cut through the middle of Asia,
were it not that the seas check it in its triumphant career
along the land. It accordingly strikes off in a northerly
direction, and forming an arc, occupies an immense tract of
country, nature, designedly as it were, every now and then
throwing seas in the way to oppose its career; here the Sea
of Phœnicia, there the Sea of Pontus, in this direction the
Caspian and Hyrcanian<a id="FNanchor_3891" href="#Footnote_3891" class="fnanchor">3891</a>, and then, opposite to them, the
Lake Mæotis. Although somewhat curtailed by these obstacles,
it still winds along between them, and makes its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_454">454</span>
way even amidst these barriers; and victorious after all, it
then escapes with its sinuous course to the kindred chain
of the Riphæan mountains. Numerous are the names
which it bears, as it is continuously designated by new ones
throughout the whole of its course. In the first part of its
career it has the name of Imaüs<a id="FNanchor_3892" href="#Footnote_3892" class="fnanchor">3892</a>, after which it is known
successively by the names of Emodus, Paropanisus, Circius,
Cambades, Paryadres, Choatras, Oreges, Oroandes, Niphates,
Taurus, and, where it even out-tops itself, Caucasus. Where
it throws forth its arms as though every now and then it
would attempt to invade the sea, it bears the names of Sarpedon,
Coracesius, Cragus, and then again Taurus. Where
also it opens and makes a passage to admit mankind, it still
claims the credit of an unbroken continuity by giving the
name of “Gates” to these passes, which in one place are
called the “Gates of Armenia<a id="FNanchor_3893" href="#Footnote_3893" class="fnanchor">3893</a>,” in another the “Gates of the
Caspian,” and in another the “Gates of Cilicia.” In addition
to this, when it has been cut short in its onward career, it
retires to a distance from the seas, and covers itself on the
one side and the other with the names of numerous nations,
being called, on the right-hand side the Hyrcanian and the
Caspian, and on the left the Paryadrian<a id="FNanchor_3894" href="#Footnote_3894" class="fnanchor">3894</a>, the Moschian, the
Amazonian, the Coraxican, and the Scythian chain. Among
the Greeks it bears the one general name of Ceraunian<a id="FNanchor_3895" href="#Footnote_3895" class="fnanchor">3895</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_28">CHAP. 28.—LYCIA.</h3></div>

<p>In Lycia, after leaving its promontory<a id="FNanchor_3896" href="#Footnote_3896" class="fnanchor">3896</a>, we come to the
town of Simena, Mount Chimæra<a id="FNanchor_3897" href="#Footnote_3897" class="fnanchor">3897</a>, which sends forth flames
by night, and the city of Hephæstium<a id="FNanchor_3898" href="#Footnote_3898" class="fnanchor">3898</a>, the heights above
which are also frequently on fire. Here too formerly stood the
city of Olympus<a id="FNanchor_3899" href="#Footnote_3899" class="fnanchor">3899</a>; now we find the mountain places known
as Gagæ<a id="FNanchor_3900" href="#Footnote_3900" class="fnanchor">3900</a>, Corydalla<a id="FNanchor_3901" href="#Footnote_3901" class="fnanchor">3901</a>, and Rhodiopolis<a id="FNanchor_3902" href="#Footnote_3902" class="fnanchor">3902</a>. Near the sea is
Limyra<a id="FNanchor_3903" href="#Footnote_3903" class="fnanchor">3903</a> with a river of like name, into which the Arycandus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_456">456</span>
flows, Mount Masycites<a id="FNanchor_3904" href="#Footnote_3904" class="fnanchor">3904</a>, the state of Andriaca<a id="FNanchor_3905" href="#Footnote_3905" class="fnanchor">3905</a>, Myra<a id="FNanchor_3906" href="#Footnote_3906" class="fnanchor">3906</a>, the
towns of Aperræ<a id="FNanchor_3907" href="#Footnote_3907" class="fnanchor">3907</a> and Antiphellos<a id="FNanchor_3908" href="#Footnote_3908" class="fnanchor">3908</a>, formerly called Habessus,
and in a corner Phellos<a id="FNanchor_3909" href="#Footnote_3909" class="fnanchor">3909</a>, after which comes Pyrra,
and then the city of Xanthus<a id="FNanchor_3910" href="#Footnote_3910" class="fnanchor">3910</a>, fifteen miles from the sea,
as also a river known by the same name. We then come
to Patara<a id="FNanchor_3911" href="#Footnote_3911" class="fnanchor">3911</a>, formerly Pataros, and Sidyma, situate on a mountain.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_457">457</span>
Next comes the Promontory of Cragus<a id="FNanchor_3912" href="#Footnote_3912" class="fnanchor">3912</a>, and beyond
it a gulf<a id="FNanchor_3913" href="#Footnote_3913" class="fnanchor">3913</a>, equal to the one that comes before it; upon it are
Pinara<a id="FNanchor_3914" href="#Footnote_3914" class="fnanchor">3914</a>, and Telmessus<a id="FNanchor_3915" href="#Footnote_3915" class="fnanchor">3915</a>, the frontier town of Lycia.</p>

<p>Lycia formerly contained seventy towns, now it has but
thirty-six. Of these, the most celebrated, besides those
already mentioned, are Canas<a id="FNanchor_3916" href="#Footnote_3916" class="fnanchor">3916</a>, Candyba, so celebrated for
the Œnian Grove, Podalia, Choma, past which the river
Ædesa flows, Cyaneæ<a id="FNanchor_3917" href="#Footnote_3917" class="fnanchor">3917</a>, Ascandalis, Amelas, Noscopium,
Tlos<a id="FNanchor_3918" href="#Footnote_3918" class="fnanchor">3918</a>, and Telandrus<a id="FNanchor_3919" href="#Footnote_3919" class="fnanchor">3919</a>. It includes also in the interior the
district of Cabalia, the three cities of which are Œnianda,
Balbura<a id="FNanchor_3920" href="#Footnote_3920" class="fnanchor">3920</a>, and Bubon<a id="FNanchor_3921" href="#Footnote_3921" class="fnanchor">3921</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_458">458</span></p>

<p>On passing Telmessus we come to the Asiatic or Carpathian
Sea, and the district which is properly called Asia.
Agrippa has divided this region into two parts; one of which
he has bounded on the east by Phrygia and Lycaonia, on the
west by the Ægean Sea, on the south by the Egyptian Sea,
and on the north by Paphlagonia, making its length to be
473 miles and its breadth 320. The other part he has
bounded by the Lesser Armenia on the east, Phrygia, Lycaonia,
and Pamphylia on the west, the province of Pontus
on the north, and the Sea of Pamphylia on the south, making
it 575 miles in length and 325 in breadth.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_29">CHAP. 29.—CARIA.</h3></div>

<p>Upon the adjoining coast is Caria<a id="FNanchor_3922" href="#Footnote_3922" class="fnanchor">3922</a>, then Ionia, and beyond
it Æolis. Caria surrounds Doris, which lies in the middle,
and runs down on both sides of it to the sea. In it<a id="FNanchor_3923" href="#Footnote_3923" class="fnanchor">3923</a> is the
Promontory of Pedalium<a id="FNanchor_3924" href="#Footnote_3924" class="fnanchor">3924</a>, the river Glaucus<a id="FNanchor_3925" href="#Footnote_3925" class="fnanchor">3925</a>, into which
the Telmedium<a id="FNanchor_3926" href="#Footnote_3926" class="fnanchor">3926</a> discharges itself, the towns of Dædala<a id="FNanchor_3927" href="#Footnote_3927" class="fnanchor">3927</a>,
Crya<a id="FNanchor_3928" href="#Footnote_3928" class="fnanchor">3928</a>, peopled by fugitives, the river Axon<a id="FNanchor_3929" href="#Footnote_3929" class="fnanchor">3929</a>, and the town

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_459">459</span></p>

<p>(28.) The river Indus<a id="FNanchor_3931" href="#Footnote_3931" class="fnanchor">3931</a>, which rises in the mountains of
the Cibyratæ<a id="FNanchor_3932" href="#Footnote_3932" class="fnanchor">3932</a>, receives sixty-five rivers which are constantly
flowing, besides upwards of 100 mountain torrents. Here
is the free town of Caunos<a id="FNanchor_3933" href="#Footnote_3933" class="fnanchor">3933</a>, then the town of Pyrnos<a id="FNanchor_3934" href="#Footnote_3934" class="fnanchor">3934</a>, the
port of Cressa<a id="FNanchor_3935" href="#Footnote_3935" class="fnanchor">3935</a>, from which the island of Rhodes is distant
twenty miles; the place where Loryma formerly stood, the
towns of Tisanusa<a id="FNanchor_3936" href="#Footnote_3936" class="fnanchor">3936</a>, Paridion<a id="FNanchor_3937" href="#Footnote_3937" class="fnanchor">3937</a>, and Larymna<a id="FNanchor_3938" href="#Footnote_3938" class="fnanchor">3938</a>, the Gulf of

Hyda, the Gulf of Schœnus, and the district of Bubasus<a id="FNanchor_3941" href="#Footnote_3941" class="fnanchor">3941</a>.
There was formerly the town of Acanthus here, another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_460">460</span>
name of which was Dulopolis. We then come to Cnidos<a id="FNanchor_3942" href="#Footnote_3942" class="fnanchor">3942</a>,
a free town, situate on a promontory, Triopia<a id="FNanchor_3943" href="#Footnote_3943" class="fnanchor">3943</a>, and after
that the towns of Pegusa and Stadia.</p>

<p>At this last town Doris begins; but, first, it may be as
well to describe the districts that lie to the back of Caria
and the several jurisdictions in the interior. The first of
these<a id="FNanchor_3944" href="#Footnote_3944" class="fnanchor">3944</a> is called Cibyratica, Cibyra being a town of Phrygia.
Twenty-five states resort to it for legal purposes, together
with the most famous city of Laodicea<a id="FNanchor_3945" href="#Footnote_3945" class="fnanchor">3945</a>.</p>

<p>(29.) This place at first bore the name of Diospolis, and
after that of Rhoas, and is situate on the river Lycus, the
Asopus and the Caprus<a id="FNanchor_3946" href="#Footnote_3946" class="fnanchor">3946</a> washing its sides. The other people
belonging to the same jurisdiction, whom it may be not
amiss to mention, are the Hydrelitæ<a id="FNanchor_3947" href="#Footnote_3947" class="fnanchor">3947</a>, the Themisones<a id="FNanchor_3948" href="#Footnote_3948" class="fnanchor">3948</a>, and
the Hierapolitæ<a id="FNanchor_3949" href="#Footnote_3949" class="fnanchor">3949</a>. The second jurisdiction receives its title<span class="pagenum" id="Page_461">461</span>
from Synnas<a id="FNanchor_3950" href="#Footnote_3950" class="fnanchor">3950</a>; to it resort the Lycaones<a id="FNanchor_3951" href="#Footnote_3951" class="fnanchor">3951</a>, the Appiani<a id="FNanchor_3952" href="#Footnote_3952" class="fnanchor">3952</a>,
the Eucarpeni<a id="FNanchor_3953" href="#Footnote_3953" class="fnanchor">3953</a>, the Dorylæi<a id="FNanchor_3954" href="#Footnote_3954" class="fnanchor">3954</a>, the Midæi, the Julienses<a id="FNanchor_3955" href="#Footnote_3955" class="fnanchor">3955</a>, and
fifteen other peoples of no note. The third jurisdiction has
its seat at Apamea<a id="FNanchor_3956" href="#Footnote_3956" class="fnanchor">3956</a>, formerly called Celænæ<a id="FNanchor_3957" href="#Footnote_3957" class="fnanchor">3957</a>, and after that
Cibotos. This place is situate at the foot of Mount Signia,
the Marsyas, the Obrima, and the Orga, rivers which fall
into the Mæander, flowing past it. Here the Marsyas,
rising from the earth, again makes its appearance, but soon
after buries itself once more at Aulocrenæ<a id="FNanchor_3958" href="#Footnote_3958" class="fnanchor">3958</a>, the spot where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_462">462</span>
Marsyas had the musical contest with Apollo as to superiority
of skill in playing on the flute. Aulocrenæ is the
name given to a valley which lies ten miles on the road
towards Phrygia from Apamea. As belonging to this jurisdiction,
it may be as well to mention the Metropolitæ<a id="FNanchor_3959" href="#Footnote_3959" class="fnanchor">3959</a>, the
Dionysopolitæ<a id="FNanchor_3960" href="#Footnote_3960" class="fnanchor">3960</a>, the Euphorbeni<a id="FNanchor_3961" href="#Footnote_3961" class="fnanchor">3961</a>, the Acmonenses<a id="FNanchor_3962" href="#Footnote_3962" class="fnanchor">3962</a>, the Pelteni<a id="FNanchor_3963" href="#Footnote_3963" class="fnanchor">3963</a>,
and the Silbiani<a id="FNanchor_3964" href="#Footnote_3964" class="fnanchor">3964</a>, besides nine other nations of no note.</p>

<p>Upon the Gulf of Doris<a id="FNanchor_3965" href="#Footnote_3965" class="fnanchor">3965</a> we have Leucopolis, Hamaxitos,
Eleus, and Euthene<a id="FNanchor_3966" href="#Footnote_3966" class="fnanchor">3966</a>. We then come to Pitaium, Eutane<a id="FNanchor_3967" href="#Footnote_3967" class="fnanchor">3967</a>,
and Halicarnassus<a id="FNanchor_3968" href="#Footnote_3968" class="fnanchor">3968</a>, towns of Caria. To the jurisdiction of
this last place six towns were appended by Alexander the
Great, Theangela<a id="FNanchor_3969" href="#Footnote_3969" class="fnanchor">3969</a>, Sibde, Medmasa, Euralium, Pedasus,
and Telmissus<a id="FNanchor_3970" href="#Footnote_3970" class="fnanchor">3970</a>. Halicarnassus lies between two gulfs,
those of Ceramus<a id="FNanchor_3971" href="#Footnote_3971" class="fnanchor">3971</a> and Iasus<a id="FNanchor_3972" href="#Footnote_3972" class="fnanchor">3972</a>. We then come to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_463">463</span>
Myndos<a id="FNanchor_3973" href="#Footnote_3973" class="fnanchor">3973</a>, and the former site of Palæomyndos; also Nariandos,
Neapolis<a id="FNanchor_3974" href="#Footnote_3974" class="fnanchor">3974</a>, Caryanda<a id="FNanchor_3975" href="#Footnote_3975" class="fnanchor">3975</a>, the free town of Termera<a id="FNanchor_3976" href="#Footnote_3976" class="fnanchor">3976</a>, Bargyla<a id="FNanchor_3977" href="#Footnote_3977" class="fnanchor">3977</a>,
and the town of Iasus<a id="FNanchor_3978" href="#Footnote_3978" class="fnanchor">3978</a>, from which the Iasian Gulf takes
its name.</p>

<p>Caria is especially distinguished for the fame of its places
in the interior; for here are Mylasa<a id="FNanchor_3979" href="#Footnote_3979" class="fnanchor">3979</a>, a free town, and that
of Antiochia<a id="FNanchor_3980" href="#Footnote_3980" class="fnanchor">3980</a>, on the site of the former towns of Symmæthos
and Cranaos: it is now surrounded by the rivers
Mæander<a id="FNanchor_3981" href="#Footnote_3981" class="fnanchor">3981</a> and Orsinus<a id="FNanchor_3982" href="#Footnote_3982" class="fnanchor">3982</a>. In this district also was formerly
Mæandropolis<a id="FNanchor_3983" href="#Footnote_3983" class="fnanchor">3983</a>; we find also Eumenia<a id="FNanchor_3984" href="#Footnote_3984" class="fnanchor">3984</a>, situate on the river
Cludros, the river Glaucus<a id="FNanchor_3985" href="#Footnote_3985" class="fnanchor">3985</a>, the town of Lysias and Orthosa<a id="FNanchor_3986" href="#Footnote_3986" class="fnanchor">3986</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_464">464</span>
the district of Berecynthus<a id="FNanchor_3987" href="#Footnote_3987" class="fnanchor">3987</a>, Nysa<a id="FNanchor_3988" href="#Footnote_3988" class="fnanchor">3988</a>, and Tralles<a id="FNanchor_3989" href="#Footnote_3989" class="fnanchor">3989</a>, also called
Euanthia<a id="FNanchor_3990" href="#Footnote_3990" class="fnanchor">3990</a>, Seleucia, and Antiochia: it is washed by the
river Eudon, while the Thebais runs through it. Some
authors say that a nation of Pygmies formerly dwelt here.
Besides the preceding towns, there are Thydonos, Pyrrha<a id="FNanchor_3991" href="#Footnote_3991" class="fnanchor">3991</a>,
Eurome<a id="FNanchor_3992" href="#Footnote_3992" class="fnanchor">3992</a>, Heraclea<a id="FNanchor_3993" href="#Footnote_3993" class="fnanchor">3993</a>, Amyzon<a id="FNanchor_3994" href="#Footnote_3994" class="fnanchor">3994</a>, the free town of Alabanda<a id="FNanchor_3995" href="#Footnote_3995" class="fnanchor">3995</a>,
which has given name to that jurisdiction, the free town of
Stratonicea<a id="FNanchor_3996" href="#Footnote_3996" class="fnanchor">3996</a>, Hynidos, Ceramus<a id="FNanchor_3997" href="#Footnote_3997" class="fnanchor">3997</a>, Trœzene<a id="FNanchor_3998" href="#Footnote_3998" class="fnanchor">3998</a>, and Phorontis.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_465">465</span>
At a greater distance<a id="FNanchor_3999" href="#Footnote_3999" class="fnanchor">3999</a>, but resorting to the same place of
jurisdiction, are the Orthronienses, the Alindienses<a id="FNanchor_4000" href="#Footnote_4000" class="fnanchor">4000</a> or Hippini,
the Xystiani<a id="FNanchor_4001" href="#Footnote_4001" class="fnanchor">4001</a>, the Hydissenses, the Apolloniatæ<a id="FNanchor_4002" href="#Footnote_4002" class="fnanchor">4002</a>, the
Trapezopolitæ<a id="FNanchor_4003" href="#Footnote_4003" class="fnanchor">4003</a>, and the Aphrodisienses<a id="FNanchor_4004" href="#Footnote_4004" class="fnanchor">4004</a>, a free people. Besides
the above, there are the towns of Coscinus<a id="FNanchor_4005" href="#Footnote_4005" class="fnanchor">4005</a>, and Harpasa<a id="FNanchor_4006" href="#Footnote_4006" class="fnanchor">4006</a>,
situate on the river Harpasus<a id="FNanchor_4007" href="#Footnote_4007" class="fnanchor">4007</a>, which also passed the
town of Trallicon when it was in existence.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_30">CHAP. 30.—LYDIA.</h3></div>

<p>Lydia, bathed by the sinuous and ever-recurring windings
of the river Mæander, lies extended above Ionia; it is joined
by Phrygia on the east and Mysia on the north, while on the
south it runs up to Caria: it formerly had the name of Mæonia<a id="FNanchor_4008" href="#Footnote_4008" class="fnanchor">4008</a>.
Its place of the greatest celebrity is Sardes<a id="FNanchor_4009" href="#Footnote_4009" class="fnanchor">4009</a>, which lies on
the side of Mount Tmolus<a id="FNanchor_4010" href="#Footnote_4010" class="fnanchor">4010</a>, formerly called Timolus. From
this mountain, which is covered with vineyards, flows the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_466">466</span>
river Pactolus<a id="FNanchor_4011" href="#Footnote_4011" class="fnanchor">4011</a>, also called the Chrysorroas, and the sources
of the Tarnus: this famous city, which is situate upon the
Gygæan Lake<a id="FNanchor_4012" href="#Footnote_4012" class="fnanchor">4012</a>, used to be called Hyde<a id="FNanchor_4013" href="#Footnote_4013" class="fnanchor">4013</a> by the people of
Mæonia. This jurisdiction is now called that of Sardes,
and besides the people of the places already mentioned, the
following now resort to it—the Macedonian Cadueni<a id="FNanchor_4014" href="#Footnote_4014" class="fnanchor">4014</a>, the
Loreni, the Philadelpheni<a id="FNanchor_4015" href="#Footnote_4015" class="fnanchor">4015</a>, the Mæonii, situate on the river
Cogamus at the foot of Mount Tmolus, the Tripolitani, who
are also called the Antoniopolitæ, situate on the banks of
the Mæander, the Apollonihieritæ<a id="FNanchor_4016" href="#Footnote_4016" class="fnanchor">4016</a>, the Mesotimolitæ<a id="FNanchor_4017" href="#Footnote_4017" class="fnanchor">4017</a>, and
some others of no note.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_31">CHAP. 31.—IONIA.</h3></div>

<p>Ionia begins at the Gulf of Iasos, and has a long winding
coast with numerous bays. First comes the Gulf of Basilicum<a id="FNanchor_4018" href="#Footnote_4018" class="fnanchor">4018</a>,
then the Promontory<a id="FNanchor_4019" href="#Footnote_4019" class="fnanchor">4019</a> and town of Posideum, and the
oracle once called the oracle of the Branchidæ<a id="FNanchor_4020" href="#Footnote_4020" class="fnanchor">4020</a>, but now of
Didymæan Apollo, a distance of twenty stadia from the sea-shore.
One hundred and eighty stadia thence is Miletus<a id="FNanchor_4021" href="#Footnote_4021" class="fnanchor">4021</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_467">467</span>
the capital of Ionia, which formerly had the names of Lelegëis,
Pityusa, and Anactoria, the mother of more than ninety
cities, founded upon all seas; nor must she be deprived of the
honour of having Cadmus<a id="FNanchor_4022" href="#Footnote_4022" class="fnanchor">4022</a> for her citizen, who was the first
to write in prose. The river Mæander, rising from a lake in
Mount Aulocrene, waters many cities and receives numerous
tributary streams. It is so serpentine in its course, that it
is often thought to turn back to the very spot from which
it came. It first runs through the district of Apamea, then
that of Eumenia, and then the plains of Bargyla; after
which, with a placid stream it passes through Caria, watering
all that territory with a slime of a most fertilizing quality,
and then at a distance of ten stadia from Miletus with a
gentle current enters the sea. We then come to Mount
Latmus<a id="FNanchor_4023" href="#Footnote_4023" class="fnanchor">4023</a>, the towns of Heraclea<a id="FNanchor_4024" href="#Footnote_4024" class="fnanchor">4024</a>, also called by the same
name as the mountain, Carice, Myus<a id="FNanchor_4025" href="#Footnote_4025" class="fnanchor">4025</a>, said to have been first
built by Ionians who came from Athens, Naulochum<a id="FNanchor_4026" href="#Footnote_4026" class="fnanchor">4026</a>, and
Priene<a id="FNanchor_4027" href="#Footnote_4027" class="fnanchor">4027</a>. Upon that part of the coast which bears the name
of Trogilia<a id="FNanchor_4028" href="#Footnote_4028" class="fnanchor">4028</a> is the river Gessus. This district is held sacred
by all the Ionians, and thence receives the name of Panionia.
Near to it was formerly the town of Phygela, built by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_468">468</span>
fugitives, as its name implies<a id="FNanchor_4029" href="#Footnote_4029" class="fnanchor">4029</a>, and that of Marathesium<a id="FNanchor_4030" href="#Footnote_4030" class="fnanchor">4030</a>.
Above these places is Magnesia<a id="FNanchor_4031" href="#Footnote_4031" class="fnanchor">4031</a>, distinguished by the surname
of the “Mæandrian,” and sprung from Magnesia in Thessaly:
it is distant from Ephesus fifteen miles, and three more
from Tralles. It formerly had the names of Thessaloche and
Androlitia, and, lying on the sea-shore, it has withdrawn from
the sea the islands known as the Derasidæ<a id="FNanchor_4032" href="#Footnote_4032" class="fnanchor">4032</a> and joined them
to the mainland. In the interior also is Thyatira<a id="FNanchor_4033" href="#Footnote_4033" class="fnanchor">4033</a>, washed
by the Lycus; for some time it was also called Pelopia and
Euhippia<a id="FNanchor_4034" href="#Footnote_4034" class="fnanchor">4034</a>.</p>

<p>Upon the coast again is Mantium, and Ephesus<a id="FNanchor_4035" href="#Footnote_4035" class="fnanchor">4035</a>, which
was founded by the Amazons<a id="FNanchor_4036" href="#Footnote_4036" class="fnanchor">4036</a>, and formerly called by so
many names: Alopes at the time of the Trojan war, after that
Ortygia and Morges, and then Smyrna, with the surname of
Trachia, as also Samornion and Ptelea. This city is built
on Mount Pion, and is washed by the Caÿster<a id="FNanchor_4037" href="#Footnote_4037" class="fnanchor">4037</a>, a river which
rises in the Cilbian range and brings down the waters of
many streams<a id="FNanchor_4038" href="#Footnote_4038" class="fnanchor">4038</a>, as also of Lake Pegasæus<a id="FNanchor_4039" href="#Footnote_4039" class="fnanchor">4039</a>, which receives<span class="pagenum" id="Page_469">469</span>
those discharged by the river Phyrites<a id="FNanchor_4040" href="#Footnote_4040" class="fnanchor">4040</a>. From these streams
there accumulates a large quantity of slime, which vastly
increases the soil, and has added to the mainland the island
of Syrie<a id="FNanchor_4041" href="#Footnote_4041" class="fnanchor">4041</a>, which now lies in the midst of its plains. In this
city is the fountain of Calippia<a id="FNanchor_4042" href="#Footnote_4042" class="fnanchor">4042</a> and the temple of Diana,
which last is surrounded by two streams, each known by the
name of Selenus, and flowing from opposite directions.</p>

<p>After leaving Ephesus there is another Mantium, belonging
to the Colophonians, and in the interior Colophon<a id="FNanchor_4043" href="#Footnote_4043" class="fnanchor">4043</a> itself,
past which the river Halesus<a id="FNanchor_4044" href="#Footnote_4044" class="fnanchor">4044</a> flows. After this we come to
the temple<a id="FNanchor_4045" href="#Footnote_4045" class="fnanchor">4045</a> of the Clarian Apollo, and Lebedos<a id="FNanchor_4046" href="#Footnote_4046" class="fnanchor">4046</a>: the city
of Notium<a id="FNanchor_4047" href="#Footnote_4047" class="fnanchor">4047</a> once stood here. Next comes the Promontory
of Coryceium<a id="FNanchor_4048" href="#Footnote_4048" class="fnanchor">4048</a>, and then Mount Mimas, which projects 150
miles into the sea, and as it approaches the mainland sinks
down into extensive plains. It was at this place that Alexander
the Great gave orders for the plain to be cut through, a
distance of seven miles and a half, for the purpose of joining
the two gulfs and making an island of Erythræ<a id="FNanchor_4049" href="#Footnote_4049" class="fnanchor">4049</a> and Mimas.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_470">470</span>
Near Erythræ formerly stood the towns of Pteleon, Helos,
and Dorion; we now find the river Aleon, Corynæum, a
Promontory of Mount Mimas, Clazomenæ<a id="FNanchor_4050" href="#Footnote_4050" class="fnanchor">4050</a>, Parthenie<a id="FNanchor_4051" href="#Footnote_4051" class="fnanchor">4051</a>, and
Hippi<a id="FNanchor_4052" href="#Footnote_4052" class="fnanchor">4052</a>, known by the name of Chytrophoria, when it
formed a group of islands; these were united to the continent
by the same Alexander, by means of a causeway<a id="FNanchor_4053" href="#Footnote_4053" class="fnanchor">4053</a> two
stadia in length. In the interior, the cities of Daphnus,
Hermesia, and Sipylum<a id="FNanchor_4054" href="#Footnote_4054" class="fnanchor">4054</a>, formerly called Tantalis, and the
capital of Mæonia, where Lake Sale now stands, are now
no longer in existence: Archæopolis too, which succeeded
Sipylum, has perished, and in their turns Colpe and Libade,
which succeeded it.</p>

<p>On returning thence<a id="FNanchor_4055" href="#Footnote_4055" class="fnanchor">4055</a> towards the coast, at a distance of
twelve miles we find Smyrna<a id="FNanchor_4056" href="#Footnote_4056" class="fnanchor">4056</a>, originally founded by an
Amazon [of that name], and rebuilt by Alexander; it is refreshed
by the river Meles, which rises not far off. Through
this district run what may almost be called the most famous
mountains of Asia, Mastusia in the rear of Smyrna, and
Termetis<a id="FNanchor_4057" href="#Footnote_4057" class="fnanchor">4057</a>, joining the foot of Olympus. Termetis is joined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_471">471</span>
by Draco, Draco running into Tmolus, Tmolus into Cadmus<a id="FNanchor_4058" href="#Footnote_4058" class="fnanchor">4058</a>,
and Cadmus into Taurus. Leaving Smyrna, the river Hermus
forms a tract of plains, and gives them its own name. It
rises near Dorylæum<a id="FNanchor_4059" href="#Footnote_4059" class="fnanchor">4059</a>, a city of Phrygia, and in its course
receives several rivers, among them the one called the Phryx,
which divides Caria from the nation to which it gives
name; also the Hyllus<a id="FNanchor_4060" href="#Footnote_4060" class="fnanchor">4060</a> and the Cryos, themselves swollen
by the rivers of Phrygia, Mysia, and Lydia. At the mouth
of the Hermus formerly stood the town of Temnos<a id="FNanchor_4061" href="#Footnote_4061" class="fnanchor">4061</a>: we
now see at the extremity of the gulf<a id="FNanchor_4062" href="#Footnote_4062" class="fnanchor">4062</a> the rocks called
Myrmeces<a id="FNanchor_4063" href="#Footnote_4063" class="fnanchor">4063</a>, the town of Leuce<a id="FNanchor_4064" href="#Footnote_4064" class="fnanchor">4064</a> on a promontory which
was once an island, and Phocæa<a id="FNanchor_4065" href="#Footnote_4065" class="fnanchor">4065</a>, the frontier town of
Ionia.</p>

<p>A great part also of Æolia, of which we shall have presently
to speak, has recourse to the jurisdiction of Smyrna;
as well as the Macedones, surnamed Hyrcani<a id="FNanchor_4066" href="#Footnote_4066" class="fnanchor">4066</a>, and the Magnetes<a id="FNanchor_4067" href="#Footnote_4067" class="fnanchor">4067</a>
from Sipylus. But to Ephesus, that other great luminary
of Asia, resort the more distant peoples known as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_472">472</span>
Cæsarienses<a id="FNanchor_4068" href="#Footnote_4068" class="fnanchor">4068</a>, the Metropolitæ<a id="FNanchor_4069" href="#Footnote_4069" class="fnanchor">4069</a>, the Cilbiani<a id="FNanchor_4070" href="#Footnote_4070" class="fnanchor">4070</a>, both the
Lower and Upper, the Mysomacedones<a id="FNanchor_4071" href="#Footnote_4071" class="fnanchor">4071</a>, the Mastaurenses<a id="FNanchor_4072" href="#Footnote_4072" class="fnanchor">4072</a>,
the Briulitæ<a id="FNanchor_4073" href="#Footnote_4073" class="fnanchor">4073</a>, the Hypæpeni<a id="FNanchor_4074" href="#Footnote_4074" class="fnanchor">4074</a>, and the Dioshïeritæ<a id="FNanchor_4075" href="#Footnote_4075" class="fnanchor">4075</a>.</p>

<div class="section">

<p>Æolis<a id="FNanchor_4076" href="#Footnote_4076" class="fnanchor">4076</a> comes next, formerly known as Mysia, and Troas
which is adjacent to the Hellespont. Here, after passing
Phocæa, we come to the Ascanian Port, then the spot where
Larissa<a id="FNanchor_4077" href="#Footnote_4077" class="fnanchor">4077</a> stood, and then Cyme<a id="FNanchor_4078" href="#Footnote_4078" class="fnanchor">4078</a>, Myrina, also called Sebastopolis<a id="FNanchor_4079" href="#Footnote_4079" class="fnanchor">4079</a>,
and in the interior, Ægæ<a id="FNanchor_4080" href="#Footnote_4080" class="fnanchor">4080</a>, Attalia<a id="FNanchor_4081" href="#Footnote_4081" class="fnanchor">4081</a>, Posidea,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_473">473</span>
Neontichos<a id="FNanchor_4082" href="#Footnote_4082" class="fnanchor">4082</a>, and Temnos<a id="FNanchor_4083" href="#Footnote_4083" class="fnanchor">4083</a>. Upon the shore we come to the river
Titanus, and the city which from it derives its name. Grynia<a id="FNanchor_4084" href="#Footnote_4084" class="fnanchor">4084</a>
also stood here on an island reclaimed from the sea and joined
to the land: now only its harbours are left<a id="FNanchor_4085" href="#Footnote_4085" class="fnanchor">4085</a>. We then come
to the town of Elæa<a id="FNanchor_4086" href="#Footnote_4086" class="fnanchor">4086</a>, the river Caïcus<a id="FNanchor_4087" href="#Footnote_4087" class="fnanchor">4087</a>, which flows from
Mysia, the town of Pitane<a id="FNanchor_4088" href="#Footnote_4088" class="fnanchor">4088</a>, and the river Canaïus. The following
towns no longer exist—Canæ<a id="FNanchor_4089" href="#Footnote_4089" class="fnanchor">4089</a>, Lysimachia<a id="FNanchor_4090" href="#Footnote_4090" class="fnanchor">4090</a>, Atarnea<a id="FNanchor_4091" href="#Footnote_4091" class="fnanchor">4091</a>,

Chrysa<a id="FNanchor_4098" href="#Footnote_4098" class="fnanchor">4098</a>, Palæscepsis<a id="FNanchor_4099" href="#Footnote_4099" class="fnanchor">4099</a>, Gergitha<a id="FNanchor_4100" href="#Footnote_4100" class="fnanchor">4100</a>, and Neandros<a id="FNanchor_4101" href="#Footnote_4101" class="fnanchor">4101</a>. We
then come to the city of Perperene<a id="FNanchor_4102" href="#Footnote_4102" class="fnanchor">4102</a>, which still survives,
the district of Heracleotes, the town of Coryphas<a id="FNanchor_4103" href="#Footnote_4103" class="fnanchor">4103</a>, the
rivers Grylios and Ollius, the region of Aphrodisias<a id="FNanchor_4104" href="#Footnote_4104" class="fnanchor">4104</a>,
which formerly had the name of Politice Orgas, the district
of Scepsis<a id="FNanchor_4105" href="#Footnote_4105" class="fnanchor">4105</a>, and the river Evenus<a id="FNanchor_4106" href="#Footnote_4106" class="fnanchor">4106</a>, on whose banks
the towns of Lyrnesos<a id="FNanchor_4107" href="#Footnote_4107" class="fnanchor">4107</a> and Miletos have fallen to decay.
In this district also is Mount Ida<a id="FNanchor_4108" href="#Footnote_4108" class="fnanchor">4108</a>, and on the coast Adramytteos<a id="FNanchor_4109" href="#Footnote_4109" class="fnanchor">4109</a>,
formerly called Pedasus, which gives its name to
the gulf and the jurisdiction so called. The other rivers are
the Astron, Cormalos, Crianos, Alabastros, and Hieros, flowing
from Mount Ida: in the interior is Mount Gargara<a id="FNanchor_4110" href="#Footnote_4110" class="fnanchor">4110</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_475">475</span>
with a town of the same name. Again, on the coast we
meet with Antandros<a id="FNanchor_4111" href="#Footnote_4111" class="fnanchor">4111</a>, formerly called Edonis, and after
that Cimmeris and Assos, also called Apollonia. The town
of Palamedium also formerly stood here. The Promontory
of Lecton<a id="FNanchor_4112" href="#Footnote_4112" class="fnanchor">4112</a> separates Æolis from Troas. In Æolis there
was formerly the city of Polymedia, as also Chrysa, and a
second Larissa. The temple of Smintheus<a id="FNanchor_4113" href="#Footnote_4113" class="fnanchor">4113</a> is still standing;
Colone<a id="FNanchor_4114" href="#Footnote_4114" class="fnanchor">4114</a> in the interior has perished. To Adramyttium
resort upon matters of legal business the Apolloniatæ<a id="FNanchor_4115" href="#Footnote_4115" class="fnanchor">4115</a>,

<p>The first place in Troas is Hamaxitus<a id="FNanchor_4124" href="#Footnote_4124" class="fnanchor">4124</a>, then Cebrenia<a id="FNanchor_4125" href="#Footnote_4125" class="fnanchor">4125</a>,
and then Troas<a id="FNanchor_4126" href="#Footnote_4126" class="fnanchor">4126</a> itself, formerly called Antigonia, and now
Alexandria, a Roman colony. We then come to the town
of Nee<a id="FNanchor_4127" href="#Footnote_4127" class="fnanchor">4127</a>, the Scamander<a id="FNanchor_4128" href="#Footnote_4128" class="fnanchor">4128</a>, a navigable river, and the spot
where in former times the town of Sigeum<a id="FNanchor_4129" href="#Footnote_4129" class="fnanchor">4129</a> stood, upon a
promontory. We next come to the Port of the Achæans<a id="FNanchor_4130" href="#Footnote_4130" class="fnanchor">4130</a>, into
which the Xanthus<a id="FNanchor_4131" href="#Footnote_4131" class="fnanchor">4131</a> flows after its union with the Simois<a id="FNanchor_4132" href="#Footnote_4132" class="fnanchor">4132</a>,
and forms the Palæscamander<a id="FNanchor_4133" href="#Footnote_4133" class="fnanchor">4133</a>, which was formerly a lake.
The other rivers, rendered famous by Homer, namely, the
Rhesus, the Heptaporus, the Caresus, and the Rhodius, have
left no vestiges of their existence. The Granicus<a id="FNanchor_4134" href="#Footnote_4134" class="fnanchor">4134</a>, taking a
different route, flows into the Propontis<a id="FNanchor_4135" href="#Footnote_4135" class="fnanchor">4135</a>. The small city of
Scamandria, however, still exists, and, at a distance of a mile<span class="pagenum" id="Page_477">477</span>
and a half from its harbour, Ilium<a id="FNanchor_4136" href="#Footnote_4136" class="fnanchor">4136</a>, a place exempt from
tribute<a id="FNanchor_4137" href="#Footnote_4137" class="fnanchor">4137</a>, the fountain-head of universal fame. Beyond the
gulf are the shores of Rhœteum<a id="FNanchor_4138" href="#Footnote_4138" class="fnanchor">4138</a>, peopled by the towns of
Rhœteum<a id="FNanchor_4139" href="#Footnote_4139" class="fnanchor">4139</a>, Dardanium<a id="FNanchor_4140" href="#Footnote_4140" class="fnanchor">4140</a>, and Arisbe<a id="FNanchor_4141" href="#Footnote_4141" class="fnanchor">4141</a>. There was also in
former times a town of Achilleon<a id="FNanchor_4142" href="#Footnote_4142" class="fnanchor">4142</a>, founded near the tomb of
Achilles by the people of Mitylene, and afterwards rebuilt
by the Athenians, close to the spot where his fleet had been
stationed near Sigeum. There was also the town of Æantion<a id="FNanchor_4143" href="#Footnote_4143" class="fnanchor">4143</a>,
founded by the Rhodians upon the opposite point,
near the tomb of Ajax, at a distance of thirty stadia from
Sigeum, near the spot where his fleet was stationed. Above
Æolis and part of Troas, in the interior, is the place called
Teuthrania<a id="FNanchor_4144" href="#Footnote_4144" class="fnanchor">4144</a>, inhabited in ancient times by the Mysians.
Here rises the river Caïcus already mentioned. Teuthrania
was a powerful nation in itself, even when the whole of Æolis
was held by the Mysians. In it are the Pioniæ<a id="FNanchor_4145" href="#Footnote_4145" class="fnanchor">4145</a>, Andera<a id="FNanchor_4146" href="#Footnote_4146" class="fnanchor">4146</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_478">478</span>
Cale, Stabulum, Conisium, Teium, Balcea<a id="FNanchor_4147" href="#Footnote_4147" class="fnanchor">4147</a>, Tiare, Teuthranie,
Sarnaca, Haliserne, Lycide, Parthenium, Thymbre, Oxyopum,
Lygdamum, Apollonia, and Pergamum<a id="FNanchor_4148" href="#Footnote_4148" class="fnanchor">4148</a>, by far the most famous
city in Asia, and through which the river Selinus runs;
the Cetius, which rises in Mount Pindasus, flowing before
it. Not far from it is Elæa, which we have mentioned<a id="FNanchor_4149" href="#Footnote_4149" class="fnanchor">4149</a> as
situate on the sea-shore. The jurisdiction of this district is
called that of Pergamus; to it resort the Thyatireni<a id="FNanchor_4150" href="#Footnote_4150" class="fnanchor">4150</a>, the
Mosyni, the Mygdones<a id="FNanchor_4151" href="#Footnote_4151" class="fnanchor">4151</a>, the Bregmeni, the Hierocometæ<a id="FNanchor_4152" href="#Footnote_4152" class="fnanchor">4152</a>,
the Perpereni, the Tiareni, the Hierolophienses, the Hermocapelitæ,
the Attalenses<a id="FNanchor_4153" href="#Footnote_4153" class="fnanchor">4153</a>, the Panteenses, the Apollonidienses,
and some other states unknown to fame. The little
town of Dardanum<a id="FNanchor_4154" href="#Footnote_4154" class="fnanchor">4154</a> is distant from Rhœteum seventy stadia.
Eighteen miles thence is the Promontory of Trapeza<a id="FNanchor_4155" href="#Footnote_4155" class="fnanchor">4155</a>, from
which spot the Hellespont first commences its course.</p>

<p>Eratosthenes tells us that in Asia there have perished the
nations of the Solymi<a id="FNanchor_4156" href="#Footnote_4156" class="fnanchor">4156</a>, the Leleges<a id="FNanchor_4157" href="#Footnote_4157" class="fnanchor">4157</a>, the Bebryces<a id="FNanchor_4158" href="#Footnote_4158" class="fnanchor">4158</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_479">479</span>
Colycantii, and the Tripsedri. Isidorus adds to these the
Arimi<a id="FNanchor_4159" href="#Footnote_4159" class="fnanchor">4159</a>, as also the Capretæ, settled on the spot where Apamea<a id="FNanchor_4160" href="#Footnote_4160" class="fnanchor">4160</a>
stands, which was founded by King Seleucus, between
Cilicia, Cappadocia, Cataonia, and Armenia, and was at first
called Damea<a id="FNanchor_4161" href="#Footnote_4161" class="fnanchor">4161</a>, from the fact that it had conquered nations
most remarkable for their fierceness.</p>

<p>Of the islands which lie before Asia the first is the one
situate in the Canopic Mouth of the Nile, and which received
its name, it is said, from Canopus, the pilot of Menelaüs. A
second, called Pharos, is joined by a bridge to Alexandria,
and was made a colony by the Dictator Cæsar. In former
times it was one day’s sail<a id="FNanchor_4162" href="#Footnote_4162" class="fnanchor">4162</a> from the mainland of Egypt; at
the present day it directs ships in their course by means of
the fires which are lighted at night on the tower<a id="FNanchor_4163" href="#Footnote_4163" class="fnanchor">4163</a> there; for
in consequence of the insidious nature of the shoals, there
are only three channels by which Alexandria can be approached,
those of Steganus<a id="FNanchor_4164" href="#Footnote_4164" class="fnanchor">4164</a>, Posideum<a id="FNanchor_4165" href="#Footnote_4165" class="fnanchor">4165</a> and Taurus.</p>

<p>In the Phœnician Sea, before Joppe there is the island of
Paria<a id="FNanchor_4166" href="#Footnote_4166" class="fnanchor">4166</a>, the whole of it forming a town. Here, they say,
Andromeda was exposed to the monster: the island also of
Arados, already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_4167" href="#Footnote_4167" class="fnanchor">4167</a>, between which and the continent,
as we learn from Mucianus, at a depth of fifty cubits
in the sea, fresh water is brought up from a spring at the
very bottom by means of leather pipes<a id="FNanchor_4168" href="#Footnote_4168" class="fnanchor">4168</a>.</p>

<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_35">CHAP. 35.—CYPRUS.</h3></div>

<p>The Pamphylian Sea contains some islands of little note.
The Cilician, besides four others of very considerable size, has
Cyprus<a id="FNanchor_4169" href="#Footnote_4169" class="fnanchor">4169</a>, which lies opposite to the shores of Cilicia and Syria,
running east and west; in former times it was the seat
of nine kingdoms. Timosthenes states that the circumference
of this island is 427 miles, Isidorus<a id="FNanchor_4170" href="#Footnote_4170" class="fnanchor">4170</a> 375; its length,
between the two Promontories of Dinæ<a id="FNanchor_4171" href="#Footnote_4171" class="fnanchor">4171</a> and Acamas<a id="FNanchor_4172" href="#Footnote_4172" class="fnanchor">4172</a> lying
on the west, is, according to Artemidorus, 160<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> miles, according
to Timosthenes, 200. Philonides says that it was
formerly called Acamantis, Xenagoras that it had the
names of Cerastis<a id="FNanchor_4173" href="#Footnote_4173" class="fnanchor">4173</a>, Aspelia, Amathusia, and Macaria<a id="FNanchor_4174" href="#Footnote_4174" class="fnanchor">4174</a>,
while Astynomus gives it the names of Cryptos<a id="FNanchor_4175" href="#Footnote_4175" class="fnanchor">4175</a> and Colinia.
Its towns are fifteen in number, Neapaphos<a id="FNanchor_4176" href="#Footnote_4176" class="fnanchor">4176</a>,
Palæpaphos<a id="FNanchor_4177" href="#Footnote_4177" class="fnanchor">4177</a>, Curias<a id="FNanchor_4178" href="#Footnote_4178" class="fnanchor">4178</a>, Citium<a id="FNanchor_4179" href="#Footnote_4179" class="fnanchor">4179</a>, Corineum, Salamis<a id="FNanchor_4180" href="#Footnote_4180" class="fnanchor">4180</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_481">481</span>

and Idalium<a id="FNanchor_4188" href="#Footnote_4188" class="fnanchor">4188</a> are no longer in existence. It is distant
from Anemurium<a id="FNanchor_4189" href="#Footnote_4189" class="fnanchor">4189</a> in Cilicia fifty miles; the sea which runs
between the two shores being called the Channel of Cilicia<a id="FNanchor_4190" href="#Footnote_4190" class="fnanchor">4190</a>.
In the same locality<a id="FNanchor_4191" href="#Footnote_4191" class="fnanchor">4191</a> is the island of Eleusa<a id="FNanchor_4192" href="#Footnote_4192" class="fnanchor">4192</a>, and the four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_482">482</span>
islands known as the Clides<a id="FNanchor_4193" href="#Footnote_4193" class="fnanchor">4193</a>, lying before the promontory
which faces Syria; and again at the end of the other cape<a id="FNanchor_4194" href="#Footnote_4194" class="fnanchor">4194</a>
is Stiria: over against Neapaphos is Hierocepia<a id="FNanchor_4195" href="#Footnote_4195" class="fnanchor">4195</a>, and opposite
to Salamis are the Salaminiæ.</p>

<p>In the Lycian Sea are the islands of Illyris, Telendos,
and Attelebussa<a id="FNanchor_4196" href="#Footnote_4196" class="fnanchor">4196</a>, the three barren isles called Cypriæ, and
Dionysia, formerly called Caretha. Opposite to the Promontory
of Taurus are the Chelidoniæ<a id="FNanchor_4197" href="#Footnote_4197" class="fnanchor">4197</a>, as many in number,
and extremely dangerous to mariners. Further on we
find Leucolla with its town, the Pactyæ<a id="FNanchor_4198" href="#Footnote_4198" class="fnanchor">4198</a>, Lasia, Nymphäis,
Macris, and Megista, the city on which last no longer exists.
After these there are many that are not worthy of notice.
Opposite, however, to Cape Chimæra is Dolichiste<a id="FNanchor_4199" href="#Footnote_4199" class="fnanchor">4199</a>, Chœrogylion,
Crambussa<a id="FNanchor_4200" href="#Footnote_4200" class="fnanchor">4200</a>, Rhoge<a id="FNanchor_4201" href="#Footnote_4201" class="fnanchor">4201</a>, Enagora, eight miles in circumference,

Strongyle, and over against Sidyma<a id="FNanchor_4204" href="#Footnote_4204" class="fnanchor">4204</a> the isle of Antiochus.
Towards the mouth of the river Glaucus<a id="FNanchor_4205" href="#Footnote_4205" class="fnanchor">4205</a>, there are Lagussa<a id="FNanchor_4206" href="#Footnote_4206" class="fnanchor">4206</a>,
Macris, Didymæ, Helbo, Scope, Aspis, Telandria, the town
of which no longer exists, and, in the vicinity of Caunus<a id="FNanchor_4207" href="#Footnote_4207" class="fnanchor">4207</a>,
Rhodussa.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_36">CHAP. 36.—RHODES.</h3></div>

<p>But the fairest of them all is the free island of Rhodes,
125, or, if we would rather believe Isidorus, 103 miles in
circumference. It contains the inhabited cities of Lindos,
Camirus<a id="FNanchor_4208" href="#Footnote_4208" class="fnanchor">4208</a>, and Ialysus<a id="FNanchor_4209" href="#Footnote_4209" class="fnanchor">4209</a>, now called Rhodos. It is distant
from Alexandria in Egypt, according to Isidorus, 583 miles;
but, according to Eratosthenes, 469. Mucianus says, that
its distance from Cyprus is 166. This island was formerly
called Ophiussa<a id="FNanchor_4210" href="#Footnote_4210" class="fnanchor">4210</a>, Asteria<a id="FNanchor_4211" href="#Footnote_4211" class="fnanchor">4211</a>, Æthria<a id="FNanchor_4212" href="#Footnote_4212" class="fnanchor">4212</a>, Trinacrie<a id="FNanchor_4213" href="#Footnote_4213" class="fnanchor">4213</a>, Corymbia<a id="FNanchor_4214" href="#Footnote_4214" class="fnanchor">4214</a>,
Pœeëssa<a id="FNanchor_4215" href="#Footnote_4215" class="fnanchor">4215</a>, Atabyria<a id="FNanchor_4216" href="#Footnote_4216" class="fnanchor">4216</a>, from the name of one of its kings; and,
in later times, Macaria<a id="FNanchor_4217" href="#Footnote_4217" class="fnanchor">4217</a> and Oloessa<a id="FNanchor_4218" href="#Footnote_4218" class="fnanchor">4218</a>. The islands of the
Rhodians are Carpathus<a id="FNanchor_4219" href="#Footnote_4219" class="fnanchor">4219</a>, which has given its name to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_484">484</span>
surrounding sea; Casos<a id="FNanchor_4220" href="#Footnote_4220" class="fnanchor">4220</a>, formerly known as Achne<a id="FNanchor_4221" href="#Footnote_4221" class="fnanchor">4221</a>; Nisyros<a id="FNanchor_4222" href="#Footnote_4222" class="fnanchor">4222</a>,
twelve miles distant from Cnidos, and formerly
called Porphyris<a id="FNanchor_4223" href="#Footnote_4223" class="fnanchor">4223</a>; and, in the same vicinity, midway between
Rhodes and Cnidos, Syme<a id="FNanchor_4224" href="#Footnote_4224" class="fnanchor">4224</a>. This island is thirty-seven miles
and a half in circumference, and welcomes us with eight fine
harbours. Besides these islands, there are, in the vicinity
of Rhodes, those of Cyclopis, Teganon, Cordylussa<a id="FNanchor_4225" href="#Footnote_4225" class="fnanchor">4225</a>, the
four islands called Diabetæ<a id="FNanchor_4226" href="#Footnote_4226" class="fnanchor">4226</a>, Hymos, Chalce<a id="FNanchor_4227" href="#Footnote_4227" class="fnanchor">4227</a>, with its city
of that name, Seutlussa<a id="FNanchor_4228" href="#Footnote_4228" class="fnanchor">4228</a>, Narthecussa<a id="FNanchor_4229" href="#Footnote_4229" class="fnanchor">4229</a>, Dimastos, Progne;
and, off Cnidos, Cisserussa, Therionarce, and Calydne<a id="FNanchor_4230" href="#Footnote_4230" class="fnanchor">4230</a>, with
the three towns of Notium, Nisyros, and Mendeterus. In
Arconnesus<a id="FNanchor_4231" href="#Footnote_4231" class="fnanchor">4231</a> there is the town of Ceramus. Off the coast
of Caria, there are the islands known as the Argiæ, twenty
in number; also Hyetussa<a id="FNanchor_4232" href="#Footnote_4232" class="fnanchor">4232</a>, Lepsia, and Leros.</p>

<p>The most noted island, however, in this gulf is that of
Cos<a id="FNanchor_4233" href="#Footnote_4233" class="fnanchor">4233</a>, fifteen miles distant from Halicarnassus, and 100 in
circumference, according to the opinion of many writers.
It was formerly called Merope; according to Staphylus, Cea;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_485">485</span>
Meropis, as Dionysius tells us; and, after that, Nymphæa.
In this island there is Mount Prion. Nisyros<a id="FNanchor_4234" href="#Footnote_4234" class="fnanchor">4234</a>, formerly
called Porphyris, is supposed to have been severed from the
island of Cos. We next come to the island of Caryanda<a id="FNanchor_4235" href="#Footnote_4235" class="fnanchor">4235</a>,
with a city of that name, and that of Pidosus<a id="FNanchor_4236" href="#Footnote_4236" class="fnanchor">4236</a>, not far
from Halicarnassus. In the Gulf of Ceramicus we also find
Priaponnesos<a id="FNanchor_4237" href="#Footnote_4237" class="fnanchor">4237</a>, Hipponnesos, Psyra, Mya, Lampsa, Æmyndus,
Passala, Crusa, Pinnicussa, Sepiussa<a id="FNanchor_4238" href="#Footnote_4238" class="fnanchor">4238</a>, and Melano. At a
short distance from the mainland is an island which bears
the name of Cinædopolis, from the circumstance that King
Alexander left behind there certain persons of a most
disgraceful character.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_37">CHAP. 37.—SAMOS.</h3></div>

<p>The coast of Ionia has the islands of Trageæ, Corseæ<a id="FNanchor_4239" href="#Footnote_4239" class="fnanchor">4239</a>,
and Icaros, which has been previously<a id="FNanchor_4240" href="#Footnote_4240" class="fnanchor">4240</a> mentioned; Lade<a id="FNanchor_4241" href="#Footnote_4241" class="fnanchor">4241</a>,
formerly called Late; and, among others of no note, the two
Camelidæ<a id="FNanchor_4242" href="#Footnote_4242" class="fnanchor">4242</a>, in the vicinity of Miletus; and the three Trogiliæ<a id="FNanchor_4243" href="#Footnote_4243" class="fnanchor">4243</a>,
near Mycale, consisting of Philion, Argennon, and
Sandalion. There is Samos also, a free<a id="FNanchor_4244" href="#Footnote_4244" class="fnanchor">4244</a> island, eighty-seven
miles in circumference, or, according to Isidorus, 100. Aristotle
tells us, that it was at first called Parthenia<a id="FNanchor_4245" href="#Footnote_4245" class="fnanchor">4245</a>, after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_486">486</span>
that Dryussa<a id="FNanchor_4246" href="#Footnote_4246" class="fnanchor">4246</a>, and then Anthemussa<a id="FNanchor_4247" href="#Footnote_4247" class="fnanchor">4247</a>. To these names
Aristocritus has added Melamphyllus<a id="FNanchor_4248" href="#Footnote_4248" class="fnanchor">4248</a> and Cyparissia<a id="FNanchor_4249" href="#Footnote_4249" class="fnanchor">4249</a>:
other writers, again, call it Parthenoarussa<a id="FNanchor_4250" href="#Footnote_4250" class="fnanchor">4250</a> and Stephane<a id="FNanchor_4251" href="#Footnote_4251" class="fnanchor">4251</a>.
The rivers of this island are the Imbrasus, the Chesius, and
the Ibettes. There are also the fountains of Gigartho and
Leucothea; and Mount Cercetius. In the vicinity of Samos
are the islands of Rhypara, Nymphæa, and Achillea.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_38">CHAP. 38.—CHIOS.</h3></div>

<p>At a distance of ninety-four miles from Samos is the free
island of Chios<a id="FNanchor_4252" href="#Footnote_4252" class="fnanchor">4252</a>, its equal in fame, with a town of the same
name. Ephorus says, that the ancient name of this island
was Æthalia; Metrodorus and Cleobulus tell us, that it had
the name of Chia from the nymph Chione; others again say,
that it was so called from the word signifying snow<a id="FNanchor_4253" href="#Footnote_4253" class="fnanchor">4253</a>; it was
also called Macris and Pityusa<a id="FNanchor_4254" href="#Footnote_4254" class="fnanchor">4254</a>. It has a mountain called
Pelennæus; and the Chian marble is well known. It is 125<a id="FNanchor_4255" href="#Footnote_4255" class="fnanchor">4255</a>
miles in circumference, according to the ancient writers; Isidorus
however makes it nine more. It is situate between
Samos and Lesbos, and, for the most part, lies opposite to
Erythræ<a id="FNanchor_4256" href="#Footnote_4256" class="fnanchor">4256</a>.</p>

<p>The adjacent islands, are Thallusa<a id="FNanchor_4257" href="#Footnote_4257" class="fnanchor">4257</a>, by some writers called
Daphnusa<a id="FNanchor_4258" href="#Footnote_4258" class="fnanchor">4258</a>, Œnussa, Elaphitis, Euryanassa, and Arginusa,
with a town of that name. All these islands are in the vicinity
of Ephesus, as also those called the Islands of Pisistratus,
Anthinæ, Myonnesos, Diarreusa,—in both of these last
there were cities, now no longer in existence,—Poroselene<a id="FNanchor_4259" href="#Footnote_4259" class="fnanchor">4259</a>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_487">487</span>

and many others of no note. In the main sea lies the
celebrated island of Teos, with a city<a id="FNanchor_4263" href="#Footnote_4263" class="fnanchor">4263</a> of that name, seventy-one
miles and a half distant from Chios, and the same from
the Erythræ.</p>

<p>In the vicinity of Smyrna are the Peristerides<a id="FNanchor_4264" href="#Footnote_4264" class="fnanchor">4264</a>, Carteria,
Alopece, Elæussa, Bachina, Pystira, Crommyonnesos, and
Megale<a id="FNanchor_4265" href="#Footnote_4265" class="fnanchor">4265</a>. Facing Troas there are the Ascaniæ, and the
three islands called Plateæ. We find also the Lamiæ, the
two islands called Plitaniæ, Plate, Scopelos, Getone, Arthedon,
Cœlæ, Lagussæ, and Didymæ.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_39">CHAP. 39.—LESBOS.</h3></div>

<p>But Lesbos<a id="FNanchor_4266" href="#Footnote_4266" class="fnanchor">4266</a>, distant from Chios sixty-five miles, is the
most celebrated of them all. It was formerly called Himerte,
Lasia, Pelasgia, Ægira, Æthiope, and Macaria, and is
famous for its nine cities. Of these, however, that of Pyrrha
has been swallowed up by the sea, Arisbe<a id="FNanchor_4267" href="#Footnote_4267" class="fnanchor">4267</a> has perished by
an earthquake, and Methymna is now united to Antissa<a id="FNanchor_4268" href="#Footnote_4268" class="fnanchor">4268</a>;
these lie in the vicinity of nine cities of Asia, along a
coast of thirty-seven miles. The towns of Agamede and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_488">488</span>
Hiera have also perished. Eresos<a id="FNanchor_4269" href="#Footnote_4269" class="fnanchor">4269</a>, Pyrrha, and the free
city of Mitylene<a id="FNanchor_4270" href="#Footnote_4270" class="fnanchor">4270</a>, still survive, the last of which was a
powerful city for a space of 1500 years. The circumference
of the whole island is, according to Isidorus, 168 miles<a id="FNanchor_4271" href="#Footnote_4271" class="fnanchor">4271</a>,
but the older writers say 195. Its mountains are, Lepethymnus,
Ordymnus, Macistus, Creon, and Olympus. It is
distant seven miles and a half from the nearest point of the
mainland. The islands in its vicinity are, Sandaleon, and
the five called Leucæ<a id="FNanchor_4272" href="#Footnote_4272" class="fnanchor">4272</a>; Cydonea<a id="FNanchor_4273" href="#Footnote_4273" class="fnanchor">4273</a>, which is one of them,
contains a warm spring. The Arginussæ<a id="FNanchor_4274" href="#Footnote_4274" class="fnanchor">4274</a> are four miles
distant from Æge<a id="FNanchor_4275" href="#Footnote_4275" class="fnanchor">4275</a>; after them come Phellusa<a id="FNanchor_4276" href="#Footnote_4276" class="fnanchor">4276</a> and Pedna.
Beyond the Hellespont, and opposite the shore of Sigeum,
lies Tenedos<a id="FNanchor_4277" href="#Footnote_4277" class="fnanchor">4277</a>, also known by the names of Leucophrys<a id="FNanchor_4278" href="#Footnote_4278" class="fnanchor">4278</a>,
Phœnice, and Lyrnesos. It is distant from Lesbos fifty-six
miles, and twelve and a half from Sigeum.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_40">CHAP. 40. (32.)—THE HELLESPONT AND MYSIA.</h3></div>

<p>The tide of the Hellespont now begins to run with greater
violence, and the sea beats against the shore, undermining
with its eddies the barriers that stand in its way, until it
has succeeded in separating Asia from Europe. At this
spot is the promontory which we have already mentioned
as Trapeza<a id="FNanchor_4279" href="#Footnote_4279" class="fnanchor">4279</a>; ten miles distant from which is the city of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_489">489</span>
Abydos<a id="FNanchor_4280" href="#Footnote_4280" class="fnanchor">4280</a>, where the straits are only seven stadia wide; then
the town of Percote<a id="FNanchor_4281" href="#Footnote_4281" class="fnanchor">4281</a>; Lampsacus<a id="FNanchor_4282" href="#Footnote_4282" class="fnanchor">4282</a>, at first called Pityusa;
the colony of Parium<a id="FNanchor_4283" href="#Footnote_4283" class="fnanchor">4283</a>, which Homer calls by the name of
Adrastia; the town of Priapos<a id="FNanchor_4284" href="#Footnote_4284" class="fnanchor">4284</a>; the river Æsepus<a id="FNanchor_4285" href="#Footnote_4285" class="fnanchor">4285</a>; Zelia<a id="FNanchor_4286" href="#Footnote_4286" class="fnanchor">4286</a>;
and then the Propontis<a id="FNanchor_4287" href="#Footnote_4287" class="fnanchor">4287</a>, that being the name given to
the tract of sea where it enlarges. We then come to the
river Granicus<a id="FNanchor_4288" href="#Footnote_4288" class="fnanchor">4288</a>, and the harbour of Artace<a id="FNanchor_4289" href="#Footnote_4289" class="fnanchor">4289</a>, where a town
formerly stood. Beyond this is an island which Alexander
joined to the continent, and upon which is Cyzicus<a id="FNanchor_4290" href="#Footnote_4290" class="fnanchor">4290</a>, a city
of the Milesians, which was formerly called Arctonnesos<a id="FNanchor_4291" href="#Footnote_4291" class="fnanchor">4291</a>,
Dolionis, and Dindymis; above it are the heights of
Mount Dindymus<a id="FNanchor_4292" href="#Footnote_4292" class="fnanchor">4292</a>. We then come to the towns of Placia,
Ariace<a id="FNanchor_4293" href="#Footnote_4293" class="fnanchor">4293</a>, and Scylace; in the rear of which places is Mount
Olympus, known as the “Mysian Olympus,” and the city of
Olympena. There are also the rivers Horisius<a id="FNanchor_4294" href="#Footnote_4294" class="fnanchor">4294</a> and Rhyndacus<a id="FNanchor_4295" href="#Footnote_4295" class="fnanchor">4295</a>,
formerly called the Lycus; this last river rises in
Lake Artynias, near Miletopolis, and receives the Macestos,
and many other streams, dividing in its course Asia<a id="FNanchor_4296" href="#Footnote_4296" class="fnanchor">4296</a> from
Bithynia<a id="FNanchor_4297" href="#Footnote_4297" class="fnanchor">4297</a>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_490">490</span></p>

<p>This country was at first called by the name of Cronia,
after that, Thessalis, and then Malianda and Strymonis. The
people of it are by Homer called Halizones<a id="FNanchor_4298" href="#Footnote_4298" class="fnanchor">4298</a>, from the fact
that it was a nation begirt by the sea. There was formerly
a vast city here, Attussa by name; at present there are
twelve cities in existence; among which is Gordiucome<a id="FNanchor_4299" href="#Footnote_4299" class="fnanchor">4299</a>,
otherwise Juliopolis; and, on the coast, Dascylos<a id="FNanchor_4300" href="#Footnote_4300" class="fnanchor">4300</a>. We
then come to the river Gelbes<a id="FNanchor_4301" href="#Footnote_4301" class="fnanchor">4301</a>; and, in the interior, the
town of Helgas, or Germanicopolis, which has also the
other name of Booscœte<a id="FNanchor_4302" href="#Footnote_4302" class="fnanchor">4302</a>; Apamea<a id="FNanchor_4303" href="#Footnote_4303" class="fnanchor">4303</a>, now more generally
known as Myrlea of the Colophonians: the river Etheleus
also, the ancient boundary of Troas, and the commencement
of Mysia. Next to this comes the gulf<a id="FNanchor_4304" href="#Footnote_4304" class="fnanchor">4304</a> into which the
river Ascanius flows, the town of Bryllion<a id="FNanchor_4305" href="#Footnote_4305" class="fnanchor">4305</a>, and the rivers
Hylas and Cios, with a town of the same name as the last-mentioned
river; it was founded by the Milesians at a place
which was called Ascania of Phrygia, as an entrepôt for the
trade of the Phrygians who dwelt in the vicinity. We may
therefore look upon this as a not ineligible opportunity for
making further mention of Phrygia.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_41">CHAP. 41.—PHRYGIA.</h3></div>

<p>Phrygia lies above Troas, and the peoples already mentioned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_491">491</span>
as extending from the Promontory of Lectum<a id="FNanchor_4306" href="#Footnote_4306" class="fnanchor">4306</a> to
the river Etheleus. On its northern side it borders upon
Galatia, on the south it joins Lycaonia, Pisidia, and Mygdonia,
and, on the east, it touches upon Cappadocia. The
more celebrated towns there, besides those already mentioned,
are Ancyra<a id="FNanchor_4307" href="#Footnote_4307" class="fnanchor">4307</a>, Andria, Celænæ<a id="FNanchor_4308" href="#Footnote_4308" class="fnanchor">4308</a>, Colossæ<a id="FNanchor_4309" href="#Footnote_4309" class="fnanchor">4309</a>, Carina<a id="FNanchor_4310" href="#Footnote_4310" class="fnanchor">4310</a>,
Cotyaion<a id="FNanchor_4311" href="#Footnote_4311" class="fnanchor">4311</a>, Ceraine, Conium, and Midaium. There are
authors who say that the Mœsi, the Brygi, and the Thyni
crossed over from Europe, and that from them are descended
the peoples called the Mysi, Phryges, and Bithyni.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_42">CHAP. 42.—GALATIA AND THE ADJOINING NATIONS.</h3></div>

<p>On this occasion also it seems that we ought to speak of
Galatia<a id="FNanchor_4312" href="#Footnote_4312" class="fnanchor">4312</a>, which lies above Phrygia, and includes the greater
part of the territory taken from that province, as also its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_492">492</span>
former capital, Gordium<a id="FNanchor_4313" href="#Footnote_4313" class="fnanchor">4313</a>. The Gauls<a id="FNanchor_4314" href="#Footnote_4314" class="fnanchor">4314</a> who have settled in
these parts, are called the Tolistobogi, the Voturi, and the
Ambitouti; those who dwell in Mæonia and Paphlagonia
are called the Trocmi. Cappadocia stretches along to the
north-east of Galatia, its most fertile parts being possessed
by the Tectosages and the Teutobodiaci. These are the
nations by which those parts are occupied; and they are
divided into peoples and tetrarchies, 195 in number. Its
towns are, among the Tectosages, Ancyra<a id="FNanchor_4315" href="#Footnote_4315" class="fnanchor">4315</a>; among the
Trocmi, Tavium<a id="FNanchor_4316" href="#Footnote_4316" class="fnanchor">4316</a>; and, among the Tolistobogi, Pessinus<a id="FNanchor_4317" href="#Footnote_4317" class="fnanchor">4317</a>.
Besides the above, the best known among the peoples of
this region are the Actalenses, the Arasenses, the Comenses<a id="FNanchor_4318" href="#Footnote_4318" class="fnanchor">4318</a>,
the Didienses, the Hierorenses, the Lystreni<a id="FNanchor_4319" href="#Footnote_4319" class="fnanchor">4319</a>, the
Neapolitani, the Œandenses, the Seleucenses<a id="FNanchor_4320" href="#Footnote_4320" class="fnanchor">4320</a>, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_493">493</span>
Sebasteni<a id="FNanchor_4321" href="#Footnote_4321" class="fnanchor">4321</a>, the Timoniacenses<a id="FNanchor_4322" href="#Footnote_4322" class="fnanchor">4322</a>, and the Thebaseni<a id="FNanchor_4323" href="#Footnote_4323" class="fnanchor">4323</a>. Galatia
also touches upon Carbalia in Pamphylia, and the Milyæ<a id="FNanchor_4324" href="#Footnote_4324" class="fnanchor">4324</a>,
about Baris; also upon Cyllanticum and Oroandicum<a id="FNanchor_4325" href="#Footnote_4325" class="fnanchor">4325</a>, a district
of Pisidia, and Obizene, a part of Lycaonia. Besides
those already mentioned<a id="FNanchor_4326" href="#Footnote_4326" class="fnanchor">4326</a>, its rivers are the Sangarius<a id="FNanchor_4327" href="#Footnote_4327" class="fnanchor">4327</a> and
the Gallus<a id="FNanchor_4328" href="#Footnote_4328" class="fnanchor">4328</a>, from which last the priests<a id="FNanchor_4329" href="#Footnote_4329" class="fnanchor">4329</a> of the Mother of
the gods have taken their name.</p>

<div class="section">
<h3 id="BOOK_V_CHAP_43">CHAP. 43.—BITHYNIA.</h3></div>

<p>And now as to the remaining places on this coast. On
the road from Cios into the interior is Prusa<a id="FNanchor_4330" href="#Footnote_4330" class="fnanchor">4330</a>, in Bithynia,
founded by Hannibal at the foot of Olympus, at a distance
of twenty-five miles from Nicæa, Lake Ascanius<a id="FNanchor_4331" href="#Footnote_4331" class="fnanchor">4331</a> lying between
them. We then come to Nicæa<a id="FNanchor_4332" href="#Footnote_4332" class="fnanchor">4332</a>, formerly called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_494">494</span>
Olbia, and situate at the bottom of the Ascanian Gulf; as
also a second place called Prusa<a id="FNanchor_4333" href="#Footnote_4333" class="fnanchor">4333</a>, at the foot of Mount
Hypius. Pythopolis, Parthenopolis, and Coryphanta are
no longer in existence. Along the coast we find the rivers
Æsius, Bryazon, Plataneus, Areus, Æsyros, Geodos, also
called Chrysorroas<a id="FNanchor_4334" href="#Footnote_4334" class="fnanchor">4334</a>, and the promontory<a id="FNanchor_4335" href="#Footnote_4335" class="fnanchor">4335</a> upon which once
stood the town of Megarice. The gulf that here runs
inland received the name of Craspedites from the circumstance
of that town lying, as it were, upon its skirt<a id="FNanchor_4336" href="#Footnote_4336" class="fnanchor">4336</a>. Astacum<a id="FNanchor_4337" href="#Footnote_4337" class="fnanchor">4337</a>,
also, formerly stood here, from which the same gulf
has received the name of the ‘Astacenian’: the town of
Libyssa<a id="FNanchor_4338" href="#Footnote_4338" class="fnanchor">4338</a> formerly stood at the spot where we now see
nothing but the tomb of Hannibal. At the bottom of
the gulf lies Nicomedia<a id="FNanchor_4339" href="#Footnote_4339" class="fnanchor">4339</a>, a famous city of Bithynia; then
comes the Promontory of Leucatas<a id="FNanchor_4340" href="#Footnote_4340" class="fnanchor">4340</a>, by which the Astacenian
Gulf is bounded, and thirty-seven miles distant
from Nicomedia; and then, the land again approaching
the other side, the straits<a id="FNanchor_4341" href="#Footnote_4341" class="fnanchor">4341</a> which extend as far as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_495">495</span>
Thracian Bosporus. Upon these are situate Chalcedon<a id="FNanchor_4342" href="#Footnote_4342" class="fnanchor">4342</a>,
a free town, sixty-two miles from Nicomedia, formerly
called Procerastis<a id="FNanchor_4343" href="#Footnote_4343" class="fnanchor">4343</a>, then Colpusa, and after that the “City
of the Blind,” from the circumstance that its founders
did not know where to build their city, Byzantium being
only seven stadia distant, a site which is preferable in every
respect.</p>

<p>In the interior of Bithynia are the colony of Apamea<a id="FNanchor_4344" href="#Footnote_4344" class="fnanchor">4344</a>,
the Agrippenses, the Juliopolitæ, and Bithynion<a id="FNanchor_4345" href="#Footnote_4345" class="fnanchor">4345</a>; the rivers
Syrium, Laphias, Pharnacias, Alces, Serinis, Lilæus, Scopius,
and Hieras<a id="FNanchor_4346" href="#Footnote_4346" class="fnanchor">4346</a>, which separates Bithynia from Galatia. Beyond
Chalcedon formerly stood Chrysopolis<a id="FNanchor_4347" href="#Footnote_4347" class="fnanchor">4347</a>, and then Nicopolis,
of which the gulf, upon which stands the Port of
Amycus<a id="FNanchor_4348" href="#Footnote_4348" class="fnanchor">4348</a>, still retains the name; then the Promontory of
Naulochum, and Estiæ<a id="FNanchor_4349" href="#Footnote_4349" class="fnanchor">4349</a>, a temple of Neptune<a id="FNanchor_4350" href="#Footnote_4350" class="fnanchor">4350</a>. We then
come to the Bosporus, which again separates Asia from
Europe, the distance across being half a mile; it is distant
twelve miles and a half from Chalcedon. The first entrance
of this strait is eight miles and three-quarters wide, at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_496">496</span>
place where the town of Spiropolis<a id="FNanchor_4351" href="#Footnote_4351" class="fnanchor">4351</a> formerly stood. The
Thyni occupy the whole of the coast, the Bithyni the interior.
This is the termination of Asia, and of the 282
peoples, that are to be found between the Gulf of Lycia<a id="FNanchor_4352" href="#Footnote_4352" class="fnanchor">4352</a>
and this spot. We have already<a id="FNanchor_4353" href="#Footnote_4353" class="fnanchor">4353</a> mentioned the length of
the Hellespont and Propontis to the Thracian Bosporus as
being 239 miles; from Chalcedon to Sigeum, Isidorus makes
the distance 322<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>.</p>

This, however, is not the fault of Pliny, but the result of imperfect
tradition. To have described <em>every</em> object <em>minutely</em> that he has named, and
of which he has given the peculiar properties, would have swollen
his book to a most enormous size, almost indeed beyond conception.</p></div>

“Conterraneus;” we have no word in English which expresses the
idea intended by the original, and which is, at the same time, a military
term. There is indeed some reason to doubt, whether the word now
inserted in the text was the one employed by the author: see the remarks
of M. Alexandre, in Lem. i. 3; also an observation in Cigalino’s dissertation

The narrative of Suetonius may serve to illustrate the observation of
Pliny: “Triumphavit (Titus) cum patre, censuramque gessit una. Eidem
collega et in tribunicia potestate, et in septem consulatibus fuit.
Receptaque ad se prope omnium officiorum cura, cum patris nomine et
epistolas ipse dictaret, et edicta conscriberet, orationesque in Senatu recitaret
etiam quæstoris vice, præfecturam quoque prætorii suscepit, nunquam
ad id tempus, nisi ab Equite Romano, administratum.” (viii. 5.)</p></div>

“Perfricui faciem.” This appears to have been a proverbial expression
among the Romans; Cicero, Tusc. Quæs. iii. 41, employs “os perfricuisti,”
and Martial, xi. 27. 7, “perfricuit frontem,” in the same sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

“Mundus.” In translating from one language into another, it is
proper, as a general principle, always to render the same word in the
original by the same word in the translation. But to this rule there are
two exceptions; where the languages do not possess words which precisely
correspond, and where the original author does not always use the
same word in the same sense. Both these circumstances, I apprehend,
apply to the case in question. The term <em>Mundus</em> is used by Pliny,
sometimes to mean <em>the earth</em> and its immediate appendages, the visible
solar system; and at other times <em>the universe</em>; while I think we may
venture to assert, that in some instances it is used in rather a vague
manner, without any distinct reference to either one or other of the above
designations. I have, in almost all cases, translated it by the term <em>world</em>,
as approaching nearest to the sense of the original. The word <em>mundus</em>
is frequently employed by Lucretius, especially in his fifth book, and
seems to be almost always used in the more extended sense of <em>universe</em>.
There are, indeed, a few passages where either meaning would be equally
appropriate, and in one line it would appear to be equivalent to <em>firmament</em>
or <em>heavens</em>; “et mundi speciem violare serenam,” iv. 138. Cicero,
in his treatise De Natura Deorum, generally uses the term <em>mundus</em> in the
sense of <em>universe</em>, as in ii. 22, 37, 58 and 154; while in one passage, ii.
132, it would appear to be employed in the more limited sense of <em>the
earth</em>. It occasionally occurs in the Fasti of Ovid, but it is not easy to
ascertain its precise import; as in the line “Post chaos, ut primum data
sunt tria corpora mundo,” v. 41, where from the connexion it may be
taken either in the more confined or in the more general sense. Manilius
employs the word very frequently, and his commentators remark, that he
uses it in two distinct senses, <em>the visible firmament</em> and the <em>universe</em>; and
I am induced to think that he attaches still more meaning to the term.
It occurs three times in the first eleven lines of his poem. In the third
line, “deducere mundo aggredior,” <em>mundus</em> may be considered as equivalent
to the celestial regions as opposed to the earth. In the ninth line,
“concessumque patri mundo,” we may consider it as signifying the
celestial regions generally; and in the eleventh, “Jamque favet mundus,”
the whole of the earth, or rather its inhabitants. We meet with it again
in the sixty-eighth line, “lumina mundi,” where it seems more properly
to signify the visible firmament; again in the 139th, “Et mundi struxere
globum,” it seems to refer especially to the earth, synonymous with the
general sense of the English term <em>world</em>; while in the 153rd line, “per
inania mundi,” it must be supposed to mean the universe. Hyginus,
in his Poeticon Astronomicon, lib. i. p. 55, defines the term as follows:
“Mundus appellatur is qui constat in sole et luna et terra et omnibus
stellis;” and again, p. 57, “Terra mundi media regione collocata.” We may
observe the different designations of the term <em>mundus</em> in Seneca; among
other passages I may refer to his Nat. Quæst. vii. 27 &amp; iii. 30; to his
treatise De Consol. § 18 and De Benef. iv. 23, where I conceive the precise
meanings are, respectively, the universe, the terrestrial globe, the firmament,
and the heavenly bodies. The Greek term <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</span>, which corresponds
to the Latin word <em>mundus</em>, was likewise employed to signify, either the
visible firmament or the universe. In illustration of this, it will be sufficient
to refer to the treatise of Aristotle <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Περὶ Κόσμου</span>, cap. 2. p. 601. See
also Stephens’s Thesaurus, <em>in loco</em>. In Apuleius’s treatise De Mundo,
which is a free translation of Aristotle’s <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Περὶ Κόσμου</span>, the term may be
considered as synonymous with universe. It is used in the same sense
in various parts of Apuleius’s writings: see Metam. ii. 23; De Deo
Socratis, 665, 667; De Dogmate Platonis, 574, 575, <em>et alibi</em>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_87" href="#FNanchor_87" class="label">87</a>
Cicero, in his Timæus, uses the same phraseology; “Omne igitur
cœlum, sive mundus, sive quovis alio vocabulo gaudet, hoc a nobis
nuncupatum est,” §&nbsp;2. Pomponius Mela’s work commences with a
similar expression; “Omne igitur hoc, quidquid est, cui mundi cœlique
nomen indideris, unum id est.” They were probably taken from a
passage in Plato’s Timæus, “Universum igitur hoc, Cœlum, sive Mundum,
sive quo alio vocabulo gaudet, cognominemus,” according to the translation
of Ficinus; Platonis Op. ix. p. 302. The word <em>cœlum</em>, which is
employed in the original, in its ordinary acceptation, signifies <em>the heavens</em>,
the visible firmament; as in Ovid, Met. i. 5, “quod tegit omnia, cœlum.”
It is, in most cases, employed in this sense by Lucretius and by Manilius,
as in i. 2. of the former and in i. 14. of the latter. Occasionally, however,
it is employed by both of these writers in the more general sense
of <em>celestial regions</em>, in opposition to the earth, as by Lucretius, i. 65, and
by Manilius, i. 352. In the line quoted by Cicero from Pacuvius, it
would seem to mean the place in which the planets are situated; De
Nat. Deor. ii. 91. The Greek word <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρανὸς</span> may be regarded as exactly
corresponding to the Latin word <em>cœlum</em>, and employed with the same
modifications; see Aristotle, De Mundo and De Cœlo, and Ptolemy,
Mag. Const. lib. i. <em>passim</em>; see also Stephens’s Thesaurus, <em>in loco</em>. Aratus
generally uses it to designate the visible firmament, as in l. 10, while in
l. 32 it means the heavenly regions. Gesner defines <em>cœlum</em>, “Mundus exclusa terra,”
and <em>mundus</em>, “Cœlum et quidquid cœli ambitu continetur.”
In the passage from Plato, referred to above, the words which
are translated by Ficinus <em>cœlum</em> and <em>mundus</em>, are in the original <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρανὸς</span>
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κόσμος</span>; Ficinus, however, in various parts of the Timæus, translates
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρανὸς</span> by the word <em>mundus</em>: see t. ix. p. 306, 311, <em>et alibi</em>.</p></div>

The following passage from Cicero may serve to illustrate the doctrine

The philosophers of antiquity were divided in their opinions respecting
the great question, whether the active properties of material bodies,
which produce the phænomena of nature, are inherent in them, and
necessarily attached to them, or whether they are bestowed upon them
by some superior power or being. The Academics and Peripatetics
generally adopted the latter opinion, the Stoics the former: Pliny adopts
the doctrine of the Stoics; see Enfield’s Hist. of Phil. i. 229, 283, 331.</p></div>

This doctrine was maintained by Plato in his Timæus, p. 310, and
adopted by Aristotle, De Cœlo, lib. ii. cap. 14, and by Cicero, De Nat.
Deor. ii. 47. The spherical form of the world, <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">οὐρανὸς</span>, and its circular
motion are insisted upon by Ptolemy, in the commencement of his astronomical
treatise <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Μεγάλη Σύνταξις</span>, Magna Constructio, frequently referred
to by its Arabic title Almagestum, cap. 2. He is supposed to have
made his observations at Alexandria, between the years 125 and 140 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>
His great astronomical work was translated into Arabic in the year 827;
the original Greek text was first printed in 1538 by Grynæus, with a
commentary by Theon. George of Trebisond published a Latin version
of it in 1541, and a second was published by Camerarius in 1551, along
with Ptolemy’s other works. John Muller, usually called Regiomontanus,
and Purback published an abridgement of the Almagest in 1541. For an
account of Ptolemy I may refer to the article in the Biog. Univ. xxxv.
263 <em>et seq.</em>, by Delambre, also to Hutton’s Math. Dict., <em>in loco</em>, and to

The account of the elements, of their nature, difference, and, more
especially, the necessity of their being four, are fully discussed by
Aristotle in various parts of his works, more particularly in his treatise
De Cœlo, lib. iii. cap. 3, 4 and 5, lib. iv. cap. 5, and De Gener. et Cor.
lib. ii. cap. 2, 3, 4 and 5. For a judicious summary of the opinions of
Aristotle on this subject, I may refer to Stanley’s History of Philosophy;
Aristotle, doctrines of, p. 2. l. 7, and to Enfield, i. 764 <em>et seq.</em> For
the Epicurean doctrine, see Lucretius, i. 764 <em>et seq.</em></p></div>

Although the word <em>planeta</em>, as taken from the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πλανήτης</span>, is
inserted in the title of this chapter, it does not occur in any part of the
text. It is not found either in Lucretius, Manilius, or Seneca, nor, I
believe, was it used by any of their contemporaries, except Hyginus, p. 76.
The planets were generally styled <em>stellæ erraticæ</em>, <em>errantes</em>, or <em>vagæ</em>,
<em>sidera palantia</em>, as in Lucretius, ii. 1030, or simply the <em>five stars</em>, as in
Cicero, De Nat. Deor. ii. 51, and in Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vii. 24. Pliny,
by including the sun and moon, makes the number seven. Aratus calls
them <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πέντ’ ἄστερες</span>, l. 454.</p></div>

“Sidera.” The word <em>sidus</em> is used, in most cases, for one of the
heavenly bodies generally, sometimes for what we term a constellation,
a particular assemblage of them, and sometimes specially for an individual
star. Manilius employs the word in all these senses, as will appear by
the three following passages respectively; the first taken from the opening
of his poem,</p>

<div class="poetry-container padt1">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Carmine divinas artes, et conscia fati</div>
<div class="line">Sidera....”</div>

<div class="poetry-container padt1">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="stanza">
<div class="line">“Hæc igitur texunt æquali sidera tractu</div>
<div class="line">Ignibus in varias cœlum laqueantia formas.” i. 275, 276.</div>

<div class="line">“... pectus, fulgenti sidere clarius;” i. 356.</div>

<p>In the Fasti of Ovid, we have examples of the two latter of these
significations:—</p>

<div class="line">Tosta sitit tellus;” iv. 939, 940.</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Lucretius appears always to employ the term in the general sense. J.
Obsequens applies the word <em>sidus</em> to a meteor; “sidus ingens cœlo
demissum,” cap. 16. In a subsequent part of this book, chap. 18 <em>et seq.</em>,
our author more particularly restricts the term <em>sidus</em> to the planets.</p></div>

It is remarked by Enfield, Hist. of Phil. ii. 131, that “with respect
to philosophical opinions, Pliny did not rigidly adhere to any sect....
He reprobates the Epicurean tenet of an infinity of worlds; favours the
Pythagorean notion of the harmony of the spheres; speaks of the universe
as God, after the manner of the Stoics, and sometimes seems to pass over
into the field of the Sceptics. For the most part, however, he leans to
the doctrine of Epicurus.”</p></div>

“Si alius est Deus quam sol,” Alexandre in Lem. i. 230. Or rather,
if there be any God distinct from the world; for the latter part of the

inanimis, atque mutis, per quandam significationem, hæc docet tributa
nomina.” “Idemque (Chrysippus) disputat, æthera esse eum, quem

The division of the planets into superior and inferior was not known
to Aristotle, De Mundo, cap. ii. p. 602, to Plato, Timæus, p. 318, 319, or
the older Greek astronomers. It was first made by the Egyptians, and
was transferred from them to the Romans. It is one of the points in
which our author differs from Aristotle. See the remarks of Marcus in
Ajasson, ii. 242 <em>et seq.</em> Marcus notices the various points which prove
the deficiency of Pliny’s knowledge of astronomy; he particularizes the
four following:—his ignorance of the true situation of the constellations;
his erroneous opinion respecting the cause of the seasons; his account of
the phases of the moon, and of the position of the cardinal points. He
appears not to have been aware, that certain astronomical phænomena
undergo a regular progression, but supposed that they remained, at the
time when he wrote, in the same state as in the age of Hipparchus or
the original observers. Columella, when treating on these subjects, describes
the phænomena according to the ancient calculation, but he informs
us, that he adopts it, because it was the one in popular use, and better
known by the farmers (De Re Rust. ix. 14), while Pliny appears not to
have been aware of the inaccuracy.</p></div>

Marcus conceives that the epithet <em>maculosa</em> does not refer to what
are called the spots on the moon, but to the circumstance of the edge of
the disc being not illuminated when it is near the full; Ajasson, ii. 286.
But, from the way in which the word is employed at the end of the
chapter, and from the explanation which is given of the cause of the
“maculæ,” I think it ought to be referred to the spotted appearance of
the face of the moon.</p></div>

“Quum laborare non creditur.” It was a vulgar notion among the
ancients, that when the moon is eclipsed, she is suffering from the influence
of magicians and enchanters, who are endeavouring to draw her
down to the earth, in order to aid them in their superstitious ceremonies.
It was conceived that she might be relieved from her sufferings by loud
noises of various kinds which should drown the songs of the magicians.
Allusion is frequently made to this custom by the ancient poets, as Virgil,
Æn. i. 742, Manilius, i. 227, and Juvenal, vi. 444; and the language has
been transferred to the moderns, as in Beattie’s Minstrel, ii. 47, “To

Astronomers describe two different revolutions or periods
of the moon; the synodical and the sidereal. The synodical marks the
time in which the moon passes from one conjunction with the sun to the
next conjunction, or other similar position with respect to the sun.
The sidereal period is the time in which the moon returns to the same
position with respect to the stars, or in which it makes a complete
revolution round the earth. These numbers are, for the synodical
period, 29ᵈ 12ʰ 44ᵐ 2·87ˢ, and for the sidereal, 27ᵈ 7ʰ 43ᵐ 11·5ˢ;

It was a general opinion among the ancients, and one which was entertained

the power of evaporating the water of the ocean. This opinion appears

produces on the tides.</p></div>

“quantum ex sole ipsa concipiat;” from this passage, taken singly,
it might be concluded, that the author supposed the quantity of light
received by the moon to differ at different times; but the succeeding
sentence seems to prove that this is not the case; see the remarks of Alexandre
in Lemaire, ii. 249. Marcus, however, takes a different view of the
subject; Ajasson, ii. 291, 292. He had previously pointed out Pliny’s
opinion respecting the phases of the moon, as one of the circumstances
which indicate his ignorance of astronomy, <em>ut supra</em>, ii. 245, 246.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_172" href="#FNanchor_172" class="label">172</a>
This doctrine is maintained by Seneca, Quæst. Nat. lib. ii. § 5. p. 701,

<p><a id="Footnote_173" href="#FNanchor_173" class="label">173</a>
I may remark, that Poinsinet, in this passage, substitutes “umbra”
for “umbræque,” contrary to the authority of all the MSS., merely because
it accords better with his ideas of correct reasoning. Although it
may be of little consequence in this particular sentence, yet, as such liberties
are not unfrequently taken, I think it necessary to state my opinion,
that this mode of proceeding is never to be admitted, and that it has
proved a source of serious injury to classical literature. In this account
of the astronomical phenomena, as well as in all the other scientific dissertations
that occur in our author, my aim has been to transfer into our
language the exact sense of the original, without addition or correction.
Our object in reading Pliny is not to acquire a knowledge of natural philosophy,
which might be better learned from the commonest elementary
work of the present day, but to ascertain what were the opinions of the
learned on such subjects when Pliny wrote. I make this remark, because I have seldom
if ever perused a translation of any classical author, where,
on scientific topics, the translator has not endeavoured, more or less, to
correct the mistakes of the original, and to adapt his translation to the
state of modern science.</p></div>

I have given the simple translation of the original as it now stands

explanations, for which I may refer to the note of Hardouin in Lemaire,
ii. 252, with the judicious remarks of Alexandre, and to those of Marcus

suppose, that Pliny, in this passage, only meant to say, that as the sun
became vertical to each successive part of the equinoctial district, no
shadows were formed in it.</p></div>

The commentators have thought it necessary to discuss the question, whether,
in this passage, Pliny refers to the Ida of Crete or of Asia Minor.
But the discussion is unnecessary, as the statement of the author is equally
inapplicable to both of them. Mela appears to refer to this opinion in
the following passage, where he is describing the Ida of Asia Minor;

This has been pointed out as one of our author’s erroneous opinions
on astronomy. The earth is really about <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>30</sub> nearer the sun in our winters

in the latter case depends upon their falling on the surface of the earth
less obliquely. This is the principal cause of the different temperatures

Petau’s Uranologie. We find, among the ancients, many traces of their
acquaintance with the period of 600 years, or what is termed the great
year, when the solar and lunar phænomena recur precisely at the same
points. Cassini, Mem. Acad., and Bailly, Hist. Anc. Astron., have shown

<p><a id="Footnote_208" href="#FNanchor_208" class="label">208</a>
“radiorum ejus contactu reguntur.” The doctrine of the ancient
astronomers was, that the motions of the planets are always governed by
the rays of the sun, according to its position, attracting or repelling them.</p></div>

A planet appears to be stationary, <em>i. e.</em> to be referred to the same
point of the zodiac, when it is so situated with respect to the earth, that a straight
line passing through the two bodies forms a tangent to the
smaller orbit. The apparent motion of the planets, sometimes direct and at
other times retrograde, with their stationary positions, is occasioned by the
earth and the planets moving in concentric orbits, with different velocities.
One hundred and twenty degrees is the mean distance at which
the three superior planets become stationary. We have an elaborate
dissertation by Marcus, on the unequal velocities of the planets, and on
their stations and retrogradations, as well according to the system of
Aristotle as to that of Copernicus; Ajasson, ii. 316 <em>et seq.</em> He remarks,
and, I conceive, with justice, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">... ce n’est pas dans les traités d’astronomie
de nos savans que l’on doit puiser les détails destinés à éclaircir le texte
des chapitres xii, xiii, xiv et xv du second livre de Pline.... Je ne dis
rien des commentaires de Poinsinet, d’Hardouin et d’autres savans peu
versés en matière d’astronomie, qui ont fait dire à Pline les plus grandes
absurdités.</span>”</p></div>

The interpretation of this passage has given rise to much discussion
among the commentators and translators; I may refer the reader to the
remarks of Poinsinet, i. 70, 71; of Alexandre in Lemaire, ii. 266; and
of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 328. I conceive the meaning of the author to be,
that while the other planets become stationary, when at 120 degrees from the
sun, Mars becomes so at 90 degrees, being detained by the rays, which act
upon him more powerfully, in consequence of his being nearer to their
source.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_212" href="#FNanchor_212" class="label">212</a>
I may refer to the remarks of Marcus on the respective distances from the
sun at which Venus and Mercury become stationary, and when
they attain their greatest elongations; Ajasson, ii. 328, 329. According
to Ptolemy, Magn. Constr. lib. viii. cap. 7, the evening setting of Venus
is at 5° 40′ from the sun, and that of Mercury at 11° 30′.</p></div>

term is employed in a somewhat different sense by the modern astronomers,
to signify the point in the orbit of a planet, when it is either at the
greatest or the least distance from the earth, or the body about which it
revolves; the former being termed the apogee, aphelion, or the higher

“quam quod illi subjacet;” under this designation the author obviously

The breadth of the zodiac, which was limited by the ancients to 12

There is considerable difficulty in ascertaining the meaning of the
terms employed by our author in describing the course of the planet
Mercury through the zodiac; “medio ejus,” “supra,” and “infra.”
Hardouin’s comment is as follows: “Duas zodiaci partes seu gradus
pererrat, quum ipse per medium incedit signiferum: supra, quum deflectit
ad Aquilonem, per quatuor alias ejusdem partes vagatur: infra, quum
descendit ad Austrum, discedit duabus.” Lemaire, ii. 271, 272. But
Marcus has shown that the opinion of Hardouin is inadmissible and inconsistent
with the facts; Ajasson, ii. 338-341. He proposes one, which
he conceives to be more correct, but we may probably be led to the conclusion,
that the imperfect knowledge and incorrect opinions of our author
on these subjects must render it impossible to afford an adequate
explanation.</p></div>

It may be remarked, that the equinoxes did not actually take place
at this period in the points mentioned by Pliny, but in the 28th degrees
of Pisces and Virgo respectively; he appears to have conformed to the
popular opinion, as we may learn from Columella, lib. ix. cap. 14. The
degrees mentioned above were those fixed by the Greek astronomers who
formed the celestial sphere, and which was about 138 years before the

that the moon is situated at an equal distance between the sun

given of Pythagoras’s opinion, and what is generally supposed to have
been his theory of the planetary system, according to which the sun, and
not the earth, is placed in the centre; Enfield’s Philosophy, i. 288, 289.
Yet we find that Plato, and many others among the ancients, give us the
same account of Pythagoras’s doctrine of the respective distances of the
heavenly bodies; Ajasson, ii. 374. Plato in his Timæus, 9. p. 312-315,
details the complicated arrangement which he supposes to constitute the
proportionate distances of the planetary bodies.</p></div>

These appellations appear to have originated from different nations
having assumed different notes as the foundation or commencement of
their musical scale. The Abbé Barthelemi informs us, that “the Dorians
executed the same air a tone lower than the Phrygians, and the latter a
tone still higher than the Lydians; hence the denomination of the Dorian,
Phrygian, and Lydian modes.” It appears to have been a general practice
to employ the lowest modes for the slowest airs; Anacharsis’s Travels,

Hence the passus will be equal to 5 Roman feet. If we estimate
the Roman foot at 11·6496 English inches, we shall have the <em>miliare</em> of
8 stadia equal to 1618 English yards, or 142 yards less than an English
statute mile. See Adam’s Roman Antiquities, p. 503; also the articles
Miliare and Pes in Smith’s Dictionary of Greek and Roman Antiquities;
and for the varieties of the stadium, as employed at different periods and
in different countries, see the article Stadium. The stadium which Herodotus
employed in measurements of Babylon has been supposed to
consist of 490 English feet, while that of Xenophon and Strabo has been

of Marcus in Ajasson, ii. 244. Under the title of comets he includes, not
only those bodies which are permanent and move in regular orbits, but
such as are transient, and are produced from various causes, the nature of
which is not well understood. See Aristotle, Meteor. lib. i. cap. 6, 7,

previous to the civil wars between Pompey and Cæsar. In reference to
the existence of a comet about the time of Julius Cæsar, Playfair remarks,
that Halley supposed the great comet of 1680 to have been the same that
appeared in the year 44 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.C.</span>, and again in Justinian’s time, 521 <span class="smcap">P.C.</span>, and

From this account it would appear, that the “fax” was what we
term a falling star. “Meteora ista, super cervices nostras transeuntia,
diversaque a stellis labentibus, modo aërolithis ascribenda sunt, modo vaporibus
incensis aut electrica vi prognata videntur, et quamvis frequentissime

<p><a id="Footnote_299" href="#FNanchor_299" class="label">299</a>
We may presume that the <em>trabes</em> are, for the most part, to be referred
to the aurora borealis. <em>The chasma</em> and the appearances described in
the twenty-seventh chapter are probably varieties of this meteor. On
these phænomena we have the following remarks by Seneca: “Lucem in
aëre, seu quamdam albedinem, angustam quidem, sed oblongam, de
noctu quandoque visam, sereno cœlo, si parallelo situ sit, Trabem vocant;
si perpendiculari, Columnam; si, cum cuspide Bolida, sive Jaculum.” Nat.
Quæst. vii. 4, and again, vii. 5, “Trabes autem non transcurrunt nec prætervolant,
ut faces, sed commorantur, et in eadem parte cœli collucent.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_300" href="#FNanchor_300" class="label">300</a>
Seneca describes this meteor, <em>ubi supra</em>, i. 14. “Sunt chasmata, cum
aliquando cœli spatium discedit, et flammam dehiscens velut in abdito
ostentat. Colores quoque horum omnium plurimi sunt. Quidam ruboris
acerrimi, quidam evanidæ et levis flammæ, quidam candidæ lucis, quidam
micantes, quidam æquabiliter et sine eruptionibus aut radiis fulvi.” Aristotle’s
account of chasmata is contained in his Meteor. lib. i. cap. 5.
p. 534.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_301" href="#FNanchor_301" class="label">301</a>
The meteor here referred to is probably a peculiar form of the
aurora borealis, which occasionally assumes a red colour. See the remarks
of Fouché, in Ajasson, i. 382.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_302" href="#FNanchor_302" class="label">302</a>
The doctrine of the author appears to be, that the prodigies are not
the cause, but only the indication of the events which succeed them.
This doctrine is referred to by Seneca; “Videbimus an certus omnium
rerum ordo ducatur, et alia aliis ita complexa sint, ut quod antecedit,
aut causa sit sequentium aut signum.” Nat. Quæst. i. 1.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_303" href="#FNanchor_303" class="label">303</a>
It would appear that, in this passage, two phænomena are confounded
together; certain brilliant stars, as, for example, Venus, which have been
occasionally seen in the day-time, and the formation of different kinds of
halos, depending on certain states of the atmosphere, which affect its
transparency.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_304" href="#FNanchor_304" class="label">304</a>
This occurrence is mentioned by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 2; he enters
into a detailed explanation of the cause; also by V. Paterculus, ii. 59,
and by Jul. Obsequens, cap. 128. We can scarcely doubt of the reality
of the occurrence, as these authors would not have ventured to relate
what, if not true, might have been so easily contradicted.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_305" href="#FNanchor_305" class="label">305</a>
The term here employed is “arcus,” which is a portion only of a circle
or “orbis.” But if we suppose that the sun was near the horizon, a
portion only of the halo would be visible, or the condition of the atmosphere
adapted for forming the halo might exist in one part only, so that
a portion of the halo only would be obscured.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_306" href="#FNanchor_306" class="label">306</a>
The dimness or paleness of the sun, which is stated by various writers
to have occurred at the time of Cæsar’s death, it is unnecessary to remark,
was a phænomenon totally different from an eclipse, and depending on a
totally different cause.</p></div>

Aristotle, Meteor. lib. iii. cap. 2. p. 575, cap. 6. p. 582, 583, and
Seneca, Quæst. Nat. lib. i. § 11, describe these appearances under the
title which has been retained by the moderns of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρήλια</span>. Aristotle remarks
on their cause as depending on the refraction (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἀνάκλασις</span>) of the
sun’s rays. He extends the remark to the production of halos (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἅλως</span>)
and the rainbow, <em>ubi supra</em>.</p></div>

This meteor has been named <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">παρασελήνη</span>; they are supposed to
depend upon the same cause with the Parhelia. A phænomenon of this
description is mentioned by Jul. Obsequens, cap. 92, and by Plutarch, in
Marcellus, ii. 360. In Shakspeare’s King John the death of Prince
Arthur is said to have been followed by the ominous appearance of five
moons.</p></div>

Perhaps the phænomena here alluded to ought to be referred to some
electric action; but they are stated too generally to admit of our forming
more than a conjecture on the subject. Virgil refers to the occurrence of
storms of wind after the appearance of a falling star; Geor. i. 265-6.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_316" href="#FNanchor_316" class="label">316</a>
These phænomena are admitted to be electrical; they are referred to
by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. i. 1. This appearance is noticed as of frequent
occurrence in the Mediterranean, where it is named the fire of St. Elmo;
see Hardouin in Lemaire, i. 311, and Fouché in Ajasson, ii. 382.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_317" href="#FNanchor_317" class="label">317</a>
Perhaps this opinion may be maintained on the principle, that, when
there is a single luminous appearance only, it depends upon the discharge
of a quantity of electrical fluid in a condensed state; its effects are, in
this case, those that would follow from a stroke of lightning.</p></div>

<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νεφέλη</span>, which are translated <em>vapor</em>, <em>nubes</em> and <em>nebula</em>, respectively. The

In his account and nomenclature of the winds, Pliny has, for the
most part, followed Aristotle, Meteor. lib. ii. cap. 4. pp. 558-560, and
cap. 6. pp. 563-565. The description of the different winds by Seneca
is not very different, but where it does not coincide with Aristotle’s, our
author has generally preferred the former; see Nat. Quæst. lib. 5. We
have an account of the different winds, as prevailing at particular seasons,
in Ptolemy, De Judiciis Astrol. 1. 9. For the nomenclature and
directions of the winds, we may refer to the remarks of Hardouin, Lemaire,
i. 328 <em>et seq.</em></p></div>

In giving names to the different winds, the author designates the
points of the compass whence they proceed, by the place where the sun
rises or sets, at the different periods of the year. The following are the
terms which he employs:—“Oriens æquinoctialis,” the place where the
sun rises at the equinox, i. e. the East. “Oriens brumalis,” where he
rises on the shortest day, the S.E. “Occasus brumalis,” where he sets
on the shortest day, the S.W. “Occasus æquinoctialis,” where he sets
at the equinox, the W. “Occasus solstitialis,” where he sets on the
longest day, the N.W. “Exortus solstitialis,” where he rises on the
longest day, the N.E. “Inter septemtrionem et occasum solstitialem,”
between N. and N.W., N.N.W. “Inter aquilonem et exortum æquinoctialem,”
between N. and N.E., N.N.E. “Inter ortum brumalem et
meridiem,” between S. and S.E., S.S.E. “Inter meridiem et hybernum
occidentem,” between S. and S.W., S.S.W.</p></div>

This has been pointed out by Alexandre, Lemaire, i. 346, as one of
the statements made by our author, which, in consequence of his following
the Greek writers, applies rather to their climate than to that of Italy.
The reader may form a judgement of the correctness of this remark by
comparing the account given by Aristotle and by Seneca; the former in
Meteor. iii. 1. p. 573, 574, the latter in Nat. Quæst. ii. 32 <em>et seq.</em></p></div>

This effect may be easily explained by the agitation into which the

Lemaire, i. 348.</p></div>

Sometimes a partial thunder-cloud is formed, while the atmosphere

have been produced by a volcanic eruption. See Lemaire, i. 348.</p></div>

The city of Bolsena is supposed to occupy the site of the ancient

Nat. Quæst. ii. 47. “Hæc sunt fulmina, quæ primo accepto patrimonio,
in novo hominis aut urbis statu fiunt.” This opinion, as well as most of
those of our author, respecting the auguries to be formed from thunder,

There is strong evidence for the fact, that, at different times, various
substances have fallen from the atmosphere, sometimes apparently of mineral,
and, at other times, of animal or vegetable origin. Some of these
are now referred to those peculiar bodies termed aërolites, the nature and
source of which are still doubtful, although their existence is no longer
so. These bodies have, in other instances, been evidently discharged from
distant volcanoes, but there are many cases where the substance could not
be supposed to have proceeded from a volcano, and where, in the present
state of our knowledge, it appears impossible to offer an explanation of
their nature, or the source whence they are derived. We may, however,
conclude, that notwithstanding the actual occurrence of a few cases of
this description, a great proportion of those enumerated by the ancients
were either entirely without foundation or much exaggerated. We meet
with several variations of what we may presume to have been aërolites in
Livy; for example, xxiv. 10, xxx. 38, xli. 9, xliii. 13, and xliv. 18, among
many others. As naturally may be expected, we have many narratives of
this kind in Jul. Obsequens.</p></div>

Aristotle treats of the Rainbow much in detail, principally in his

which is, for the most part, correct, and attempts to form a theory for
them; see especially cap. 4. p. 577 <em>et seq.</em> In the treatise De Mundo he
also refers to the same subject, and briefly sums up his doctrine with the
following remark: “arcus est species segmenti solaris vel lunaris, edita in
nube humida, et cava, et perpetua; quam velut in speculo intuemur, imagine
relata in speciem circularis ambitûs.” cap. 4. p. 607. Seneca also

remark, that Hardouin interprets it in a somewhat different manner;

As our author admits of the existence of antipodes, and expressly

to the cone of the pine is to be taken in a very general sense.
How far the ancients entertained correct opinions respecting the globular
figure of the earth, or rather, at what period this opinion became generally
admitted, it is perhaps not easy to ascertain. The lines in the Georgics,
i. 242, 243, which may be supposed to express the popular opinion in the
time of Virgil, certainly do not convey the idea of a sphere capable of
being inhabited in all its parts:</p>

“... Alpium vertices, longo tractu, nec breviore quinquaginta millibus

author conceiving of the Alps as 50 miles high, the commentators have,
according to their usual custom, exercised their ingenuity in altering the
text. See Poinsinet, i. 206, 207, and Lemaire, i. 373. But the expression
does not imply that he conceived them as 50 miles in perpendicular
height, but that there is a continuous ascent of 50 miles to get to the
summit. This explanation of the passage is adopted by Alexandre; Lemaire,
<em>ut supra</em>. For what is known of Dicæarchus I may refer to Hardouin,

We may presume that the author meant to convey the idea, that
the eclipses which are visible in any one country are not so in those
which are situated under a different meridian. The terms “vespertinos,”

but to the situation of the eclipse, whether recurring in the western,
eastern, or southern parts of the heavens.</p></div>

Hardouin, according to his usual custom, employs all his learning

as it must be confessed, with but too much reason, remarks, “Frustra
desudavit Harduinus ut sanum aliquem sensum ex illis Plinii deliramentis
excuteret.” He correctly refers the interval of time, which was
said to occur between these signals, not to any astronomical cause, but to
the necessary delay which took place in the transmission of them. He
concludes, “Sed ad cursum solis hoc referre, dementiæ est. Nam ut tanta
horarum differentia intersit, si moram omnem in speculandis ac transmittendis
signis sustuleris, necesse erit observatores illos ultimos 135
gradibus, id est, sesquidimidio hemisphærio, a primis distare furribus.

The distance, as here stated, is about 150 miles, which he is said to
have performed in nine hours, but that the same distance, in returning,
required fifteen hours. We have here, as on the former occasion, a note
of Hardouin’s to elucidate the statement of the author. On this Alexandre
observes, “Optime; sed in tam parva locorum distantia, Elidis et
Sicyonis horologia vix quinque unius horæ sexagesimis differre poterant;
quare eunti ac redeunti ne discrimen quidem quadrantis horæ intererat.

We are not to expect any great accuracy in these estimates, and we

ch. 39, makes the shadow at Ancona <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>35</sub> greater than the gnomon,
while, in Venetia, which is more northerly, he says, as in the present

It has been supposed, that in this passage the author intended to

at the other parts of the year; see Alexandre in Lemaire, i. 399, 400.
But to this, I conceive, it may be objected, that the words “inter ortus
solis” can scarcely apply to the period while the sun is below the horizon,
and that the solstices generally would seem to be opposed to the equinoxes
generally. Also the words “obliquior” and “rectior” would appear to
have some farther reference than merely to the length of time during
which the sun is above or below the horizon.</p></div>

This circumstance is mentioned by Seneca, Nat. Quæst. vi. 28, as occurring

volcanos being raised up into the atmosphere. It does not appear that
there is, at present, any cavern in Mount Soracte which emits mephitic
vapours. But the circumstance of Soracte being regarded sacred to
Apollo, as we learn from our author, vii. 2, and from Virgil, Æn. xi. 785,

There is, no doubt, some truth in these accounts of floating islands,
although, as we may presume, much exaggerated. There are frequently
small portions of land detached from the edges of lakes, by floods or
rapid currents, held together and rendered buoyant by a mass of roots
and vegetable matter. In the lake of Keswick, in the county of Cumberland,
there are two small floating islands, of a few yards in circumference,
which are moved about by the wind or by currents; they appear
to consist, principally, of a mass of vegetable fibres.</p></div>

The modern names of the rivers and lakes here mentioned are the
Liris, communicating with the Lago di Celano; the Adda, with the Lago
di Como; the Ticino, with the Lago Maggiore; the Mincio, with the
Lago di Guarda; the Oglio, with the Lago di Sero; and the Rhone with
the Lake of Geneva. There may be some foundation for the alleged fact,
because the specific gravity and the temperature of the lake may differ a
little from that of the river which passes through it.</p></div>

According to Brotier, “fons ille olim nobilissimus, nunc ignobile
est lavacrum, cujus aqua marino sapore inficitur.” He conceives that
there is no actual foundation for this so frequently repeated story; and
conjectures that it originated from the similitude of the names, the
fountain in Sicily and the river in the Peloponnesus being both named
Alpheus. He goes on to mention some examples of springs of fresh
water rising up on the sea-coast; Lemaire, i. 438. The allusion to the
fountain of Arethusa, by Virgil, in the commencement of the 10th eclogue,
is well known to all classical scholars. The lines of Virgil have been
elegantly imitated by Voltaire, in the Henriade, ix. 269, 270.</p></div>

From a note in Poinsinet, i. 302, we learn that there has been some
doubt respecting the locality of this river. It is mentioned by Virgil,
Æn. i. 244, and it forms the subject of Heyne’s 7th Excursus, ii. 124 <em>et
seq.</em> Virgil also speaks of the Timavus, Ec. viii. 6; and Heyne, in a note,
gives the following description of it: “Timavus in ora Adriæ, non longe
ab Aquileia fluvius ex terra novem fontibus seu capitibus progressus,
brevi cursu, in unum alveum collectus, lato altoque flumine in mare
exit.” i. 127, 128.</p></div>

This remark is not to be taken in its full extent; the water of these
lakes contains a large quantity of saline and other substances dissolved
in it, and, consequently, has its specific gravity so much increased, that
various substances float on it which sink in pure water.</p></div>

In a subsequent part of the work, xxxi. 8, our author remarks,
“Reatinis tantum paludibus ungulas jumentorum indurari.” We may
presume that the water contained some saline, earthy or metallic substance,
either in solution, or in a state of minute division, which would produce
these effects. It does not appear that anything of this kind has been
observed by the moderns in this water.</p></div>

We have an account of the Troglodytæ in a subsequent part of the

of their dwellings being composed of caverns; a <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">τρωγλὴ</span> and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">δύνω</span>.
Alexandre remarks, that the name was occasionally applied to other tribes,

Strabo, in allusion to this circumstance, remarks, that some persons

with the Nile. We learn from Tournefort, that there is a well of this

January and February than in October, and which is supposed to be connected
with the Nile or the Jordan: this, of course, he regards as an idle

parts of the globe, as known to the ancients, but the number of miles

in the first instance, a considerable part of the way by sea, and, in the

This is said more especially in reference to the western parts of Asia,

Now the Don. It was usually looked upon as the boundary between
Europe and Asia. Pliny’s meaning seems to be, that the Tanais divides
Asia from Europe, and the Nile, Asia from Africa, the more especially
as the part to the west of the Nile was sometimes considered as belonging
to Asia. It has been however suggested that he intends to assign these
rivers as the extreme eastern boundaries of the internal or Mediterranean
sea.</p></div>

The <em>Roman</em> colonies or colonies “civium Romanorum” are those
here meant. The colonists in such case enjoyed all the rights of Roman

of the Roman magistracy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_826" href="#FNanchor_826" class="label">826</a>
“Municipia.” These were towns in conquered countries which were
<em>not</em> founded by the Romans, but whose inhabitants retained their original
institutions, at the same time receiving certain of the rights of Roman
citizens; most frequently, immunity to a greater or less degree from
payment of tribute.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

“Latium;” also called “Jus Latii” and “Latinitas.” This was the
name given to those circumscribed or limited rights as Roman citizens
which were at first bestowed upon the conquered states of Italy, before
the time of the Social War. Indeed the <em>Latinus</em> held a kind of intermediate
state between the <em>Civis Romanus</em> with all his rights, and the
<em>peregrinus</em> or foreigner with all his disabilities. These Latin rights were
afterwards extended to the people of other countries, but retained their
original name.</p></div>

From the numerous creeks or æstuaries with which the coast is here

Some readings have “Hareni montes,” and others “Arenæ montes,”
the “mountains of sand.” There is no doubt that the sandy heights or

“Dunes” by the French, and by the natives “Arenas gordas.”</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_833" href="#FNanchor_833" class="label">833</a>
Probably the line of sea-shore between Roia and the city of Cadiz,

Hardouin says that the present Vejer is the place meant, while others

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_837" href="#FNanchor_837" class="label">837</a>
Hardouin and other commentators suggest that the site of the present

The exact site of Carteia is unknown; but it is generally supposed
to have stood upon the bay which opens out of the straits on the west of
the Rock of Gibraltar, now called the Bay of Algesiras or Gibraltar; and
upon the hill at the head of the bay of El Rocadillo, about half-way
between Algesiras and Gibraltar.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_840" href="#FNanchor_840" class="label">840</a>
We learn also from Strabo, that Tartessus was the same place as
Carteia; it is not improbable that the former was pretty nearly the
Phœnician name of the place, and the latter a Roman corruption of it,
and that in it originated the ‘Tarshish’ of Scripture, an appellation
apparently given to the whole of the southern part of the Spanish peninsula.
Probably the Greeks preserved the appellation of the place more
in conformity with the original Phœnician name.</p></div>

it is more probable that Guadalmedina, which is much nearer to it,
is the stream alluded to.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_846" href="#FNanchor_846" class="label">846</a>
Not improbably Velez Malaga, upon a river of the same name.

In relation to the ‘conventus juridicus,’ we may here observe that
under the Roman sway, in order to facilitate the administration of justice,
a province was divided into a number of districts or circuits, each of
which was so called, as also ‘forum’ or ‘jurisdictio’. At certain times of
the year fixed by the proconsul or chief magistrate, the people assembled
in the chief town of the district (whence the name ‘conventus’), upon
which judges were selected to try the causes of litigant parties.</p></div>

Ansart suggests that the reading is not Sacili of the Martiales,
but Onoba of the Martiales, to distinguish it from Onoba Æstuaria,
previously mentioned. It is not improbable that the place was so called
from the Martian or Martial legion having originally colonized it. The
site of Onoba is unknown.</p></div>

Cordova was so called from the great number of patricians, who were
among the original colonists, when it was founded by Marcellus. To the present day
it is noted for the pride of its nobles. The Great Captain
Gonzalo de Cordova used to say, that “other towns might be better to
live in, but there was none better to be born in.” It was the birth-place
of Lucan and the two Senecas.</p></div>

The present city of Ossuna. “Genua Urbanorum” would seem to
mean “the knees of the citizens.” Though all the MSS. agree in this reading,
it probably is an error for “gemina Urbanorum,” and it may have been
a colony of one of the legions called ‘geminæ’ or ‘gemellæ,’ as previously
mentioned. The other part of its appellation may possibly have originated
in the fact of its first inhabitants being all natives of the city of Rome.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_912" href="#FNanchor_912" class="label">912</a>
The use of the word <em>fuit</em>, ‘was,’ implies that the place had been
destroyed. Cneius Pompeius, the eldest son of Pompey the Great, was
defeated at Munda, in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 45, and the town destroyed. Pompey
escaped from the battle, but was taken a short time after and
put to death. The site of the ancient town is very generally supposed
to be the modern village of Monda, S.W. of Malaga, and about three
leagues from the sea. It is more probable however that it was in the
vicinity of Cordova, and there are ruins of ancient walls and towers between
Martos, Alcandete, Espejo and Baena, which are supposed to denote
its site.</p></div>

the usage in Bætica more generally to distinguish the towns by their
Roman names.</p></div>

Q. Cæcilius Metellus, and enclosing the two temples of Juno and of Jupiter
Stator. It contained a public library, in which the Senate often

city was taken and destroyed; which event put an end to the Sertorian
war. It was called “Nassica,” in contradistinction to Calagurris Fibularia,
which is afterwards mentioned by Pliny. The latter is mentioned by

they have been generally omitted, as wrongly introduced, and as utterly

with the name ‘Sblaie’ or ‘Splaie,’ inscribed in Celtiberian characters,
and numismatists are of opinion that they indicate the name of the town
of this people, which in Latin would be Ispala. This at all events is the

It may be worth while here to take some notice of the mineral productions
of Spain in modern times, from which we shall be able to form
a more accurate judgement as to the correctness of the statement here
made by Pliny. Grains of gold are still to be found in the rivers Tagus
and Douro; but there is not found sufficient of the precious metal to pay
for the search. Silver is found in the mines of the Guadal canal. Copper
and lead are to be found in abundance. There is a mine of plumbago
four leagues from Ronda; and tin is found in Gallicia. In every province
there are iron mines, those in Biscay being the most remarkable.
Lodestone is found in Seville, cobalt on the Pyrenees, quicksilver and
cinnabar at Almaden, arsenic in Asturias, and coal in Asturias and Arragon.
There are salt-mines at Mingrilla and Cardona; alum is found in Arragon,
antimony at Alcaraz. On the Sierra Morena, and in Gallicia, there
is saltpetre in numerous localities; amber in Asturias and Valencia, and
sulphur in Murcia, Arragon, and Seville. Pipe-clay of a peculiar quality is
found in the vicinity of Andujar. Gypsum and marble are found in great
abundance, and stone for budding purposes, of the best quality. Amethysts,
white cornelians, rubies, agates, garnets, and rock crystals, with
other precious stones, are also found in abundance and of the finest quality.</p></div>

Dalechamp takes this to be Foz les Martigues; but the locality is

Strabo as Rhoë, in conjunction with the town of Agathe or Agde, and
the Rodanusia of Stephen of Byzantium, who places it in the district of
Massilia or Marseilles.</p></div>

Most probably from Libici, a town in the south of Gaul, of which
there are coins in existence, but nothing else seems to be known. At
the present day there are four mouths of the Rhone, the most westerly
of which is called the “Dead” Rhone; the next the “Lesser” Rhone;
the third the “Old” Rhone; and the fourth simply the Rhone. D’Anville considers
the “Lesser” Rhone to have been the “Spanish” mouth
of the ancients. In consequence of the overflowings of this river there is
great confusion upon this subject.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1086" href="#FNanchor_1086" class="label">1086</a>
This mouth of the Rhone was much used by the Massilians for the
purposes of commerce with the interior of Gaul, and the carriage of the
supplies of tin which they obtained thence.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_1087" href="#FNanchor_1087" class="label">1087</a>
The manner in which Pliny here expresses himself shows that he
doubts the fact of such a place having even existed; it is mentioned by
none of the preceding geographers, and of those who followed him Stephen
of Byzantium is the only one who notices it. An inscription was found
however in the reign of Charles V. of France, in which it was stated that
Ataulphus, king of the Visigoths, selected Heraclea as his place of residence.
On the faith of this inscription, Spon and Ducange have placed
Heraclea at the modern Saint-Gilles, and other writers at Saint-Remy,
where the inscription was found. Unfortunately, however, Messrs. Devic
and Vaissette, in their “History of Languedoc,” have proved that this
inscription is of spurious origin.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_1088" href="#FNanchor_1088" class="label">1088</a>
The “Fossæ Marianæ” are also mentioned by Ptolemy and Solinus;
though they differ in the situation which they have respectively assigned
them. They were formed by Marius when advancing to dispute the
passage of the Rhone with the Cimbri, who had quitted Spain for the
purpose of passing the Pyrenees and invading Italy, in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 102.
There is considerable difficulty in determining their position, but they
are supposed to have commenced at the place now called the Camp of
Marius, and to have terminated at the eastern mouth of the Rhone near
the present Arles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1089" href="#FNanchor_1089" class="label">1089</a>
Pliny is the first who mentions the name of this lake, though previous
writers had indicated its existence. Strabo informs us that above
the mouth of the Rhone there is a large lake that communicates with the
sea, and abounds in fish and oysters. Brotier and D’Anville identify it
with the present lake of Martigues or of Berre.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1090" href="#FNanchor_1090" class="label">1090</a>
D’Anville takes this place to be the present town of Martigues; Brotier
thinks that it was situate on the spot now called Le Cap d’Œil, near
the town of Saint-Chamas; and Bouche, the historian of the Province,
places it at Marignane, on the east side of the lake already mentioned.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1091" href="#FNanchor_1091" class="label">1091</a>
“Campi Lapidei,” called by the natives at the present day “La Crau;”
probably from the same Celtic root as our word “Crags;” though Bochart
derives it from the Hebrew. Æschylus and Hyginus speak of this combat of Hercules,
and Mela relates that being engaged in a mortal struggle
with Albion and Geryon, the sons of Neptune, he invoked the aid of
Jupiter, on which a shower of stones fell from the heavens and destroyed
his antagonists. Those on this plain are said to be the remains of the
stony shower. It is supposed by the scientific that many of these stones
are aërolites, and that tradition has ingeniously adapted this story to
their real origin. The vicinity of Tunbridge Wells presents a somewhat
similar appearance.</p></div>

This seems to be the meaning of “alumna,” and not “nurse” or
“foster-mother,” as Ajasson’s translation has it. Pliny probably implies
by this antithesis that Rome has been “twice blessed,” in receiving
the bounties of all nations of the world, and in being able to bestow a
commensurate return. Compared with this idea, “at once the nurse and
mother of the world” would be tame indeed!</p></div>

Or “Great Greece.” This is a poor and frivolous argument used by
Pliny in support of his laudations of Italy, seeing that in all probability
it was not the people of Greece who gave this name to certain cities
founded by Greek colonists on the Tarentine Gulf, in the south of Italy;
but either the Italian tribes, who in their simplicity admired their splendour
and magnificence, or else the colonists themselves, who, in using
the name, showed that they clung with fondness to the remembrance of
their mother-country; while at the same time the epithet betrayed some
vanity and ostentation in wishing thus to show their superiority to the
people of their mother-country.</p></div>

The comparison of its shape to an oak leaf seems rather fanciful;
more common-place observers have compared it to a boot: by the top
(cacumen) he seems to mean the southern part of Calabria about Brundisium
and Tarentum; which, to a person facing the south, would incline
to the coast of Epirus on the left hand.</p></div>

The ‘Parma’ or shield here alluded to, would be one shaped like a
crescent, with the exception that the inner or concave side would be
formed of two crescents, the extremities of which join at the central projection.
He says that Cocinthos (now Capo di Stilo) would in such
case form the central projection, while Lacinium (now Capo delle Colonne)
would form the horn at the extreme right, and Leucopetra (now Capo
dell’ Armi) the horn on the extreme left.</p></div>

Or Horta; the spot now called Orte, where numerous Etruscan remains

closer proximity to Vesuvius caused it to be buried under a more solid
body of materials ejected from the mountain than was the case with
Pompeii; which seems to have been suffocated with ashes, while Herculaneum
was covered with volcanic tufa most probably hardened by the
agency of water. A few scattered inhabitants are supposed to have afterwards
settled upon the site where it was buried, which for many centuries
was utterly forgotten, till brought to light in 1738. Part of the site

It probably had its name from Campania, of which it was the capital,
and which was so called from its extensive <em>campi</em> or plains. The
site of this luxurious and magnificent city is now occupied by the village

of ancient Casilinum. Of ancient Capua there are but few remains. It

This city was finally destroyed in the wars of the Greeks and Lombards,
and the modern Avellino rose on its site. There are considerable ruins in
the vicinity. According to Hardouin, this place also claimed the honour
of giving name to filberts, which grew abundantly in its vicinity. If such
is the case, it seems probable that both it and Abella took their names
from that fruit as called by the early inhabitants. See Note <a href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor">1335</a> p. 198.</p></div>

The Lares Compitales presided over the divisions of the city, which
were marked by the <em>compita</em> or points where two or more streets crossed
each other, and where ‘ædiculæ’ or small chapels were erected in their
honour. Statues of these little divinities were erected at the corner of
every street. It was probably this custom which first suggested the idea

Supposing the circuit of the city to have been as he says, 13<sup>2</sup>&frasl;<sub>5</sub> miles, he
must either make a great miscalculation here, or the text must be very corrupt.
The average diameter of the city would be in such case about 4<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub> miles,
the average length of each radius drawn from the mile-column 2<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> miles,
and the total amount 83<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> miles, whereas he makes it but 20<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub> miles, or little
better than an average of half-a-mile for each radius. We may also
remark that the camp of the Prætorian cohorts here mentioned was
established by the emperor Tiberius, by the advice of Sejanus. Ajasson’s
translation makes the measurement to be made to <em>twelve</em> gates only, but

An ancient city of Latium, subdued by Tarquinius Priscus, on which
occasion Ocrisia, the mother of Servius Tullius, fell into the hands of the
Romans as a captive. It was probably situate on one of the isolated
hills that rise from the plain of the Campagna.</p></div>

Said to have been so called from being “opposite” to the ancient

A very ancient city situate three miles from Rome, and said to have

An ancient city of Latium. It probably gradually fell into decay.
Lucius Tarquinius, the husband of Lucretia, is represented as dwelling here

“Populi Albenses.” It does not appear to be exactly known what
is the force of this expression, but he probably means either colonies from
Alba, or else nations who joined in the confederacy of which Alba was the
principal. Niebuhr looks upon them as mere demi or boroughs of the
territory of Alba.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1411" href="#FNanchor_1411" class="label">1411</a>
“Accipere carnem.” Literally, “to take the flesh.” It appears that
certain nations, of which Alba was the chief, were in early times accustomed
to meet on the Alban Mount for the purposes of sacrifice. The
subject is full of obscurity, but it has been suggested that this minor confederacy
co-existed with a larger one including all the Latin cities, and
there can be little doubt that the common sacrifice was typical of a bond
of union among the states that partook therein. It does not necessarily
appear from the context that more than the thirty-one states <em>after</em> mentioned
took part therein, though the text may be so construed as to imply
that the Latin nations previously mentioned also shared in the sacrifice;
if so, it would seem to imply that Alba was the chief city of the <em>whole</em>
Latin confederacy. See this subject ably discussed in Dr. Smith’s Dictionary
of Ancient Geography, under the article <em>Latini</em>.</p></div>

This city took the lead in the war of the Latin cities against Tarquinius
Priscus. Gell and Nibby think that it was situate about eleven
miles from Rome, a mile to the south of the Appian way, where there
are some remains that indicate the site of an ancient city, near the stream
called the Fosso delle Fratocche. Livy tells us that with the spoils
thence derived, Tarquinius celebrated the <em>Ludi Magni</em> for the first time.</p></div>

inhabitants were forced to abandon their town and live in the adjoining
villages. The name of Picentini was given, as here stated, to the inhabitants
of all the territory between the Promontory of Minerva and the
river Silarus. They were a portion of the Sabine Picentes, who were

By using the genitive ‘Salerni,’ he would seem to imply that the
Roman colony of Salernum then gave name to the district of which Picentia
was the chief town. Ajasson however has translated it merely
“Salernum and Picentia.” ‘Intus’ can hardly mean “inland,” as
Picentia was near the coast, and so was Salernum.</p></div>

The former editions mostly omit “nec”; and so make it that Ebusus

Ovid, like many other writers, mentions Inarime as though a different
island from Pithecusæ. See Met. B. xiv. l. 89. As is here mentioned by
Pliny, many persons derived the name “Pithecusæ” from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πίθηκος</span> “an
ape,” and, according to Strabo, “Aremus” was the Etrurian name for an
ape. Ovid, in the Metamorphoses, <em>loc. cit.</em>, confirms this tradition by
relating the change of the natives into apes. The solution of its name
given by Pliny appears however extremely probable, that it gained its
name from its manufacture of <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πιθηκὰ</span>, or earthen vessels. Virgil is supposed
to have coined the name of “Inarime.”</p></div>

Or Gnatia, called by Strabo and Ptolemy a city of Apulia. It was
probably the last town of the Peucetians towards the frontiers of Calabria.
Horace, in the account of his journey to Brundusium (I. Sat. i. 97-100),
makes it his last halting-place, and ridicules a pretended miracle shown
by the inhabitants, who asserted that incense placed on a certain altar
was consumed without fire being applied. The same story is referred to
by Pliny, B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_111">111</a>, where he incorrectly makes Egnatia a town of the
Salentini. Its ruins are visible on the sea-coast, about six miles S.E. of
Monopali, and an old town still bears the name of Torre d’Agnazzo.</p></div>

but in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 268, a Roman colony was settled there, on which
occasion, prompted by superstitious feelings, the Romans changed its
name Maleventum, which in their language would mean “badly come,”
to Beneventum or “well come.” The modern city of Benevento still

Æcæ is supposed to have been situate about nineteen miles from
Herdonia, and to have been on the site of the modern city of Troja, an
episcopal see. The Compsani were the people of Compsa, the modern
Conza; and the Caudini were the inhabitants of Caudium, near which
were the Fauces Caudinæ or “Caudine Forks,” where the Roman army was
captured by the Samnites. The site of this city was probably between
the modern Arpaja and Monte Sarchio; and the defeat is thought to
have taken place in the narrow valley between Santa Agata and Moirano,
on the road from the former place to Benevento, and traversed by the
little river Iselero. The enumeration here beginning with the Æclani is
thought by Hardouin to be of nations belonging to Apulia, and not to
the Hirpini. The Æclani, here mentioned, were probably the people
of the place now called Ascoli di Satriano, not far from the river Carapella.

that there were three places of this name. One Cominium is mentioned
in the Samnite wars as being about twenty miles from Aquilonia, while Cominium Ceritum,
probably another place, is spoken of by Livy
in his account of the second Punic War. The latter, it is suggested, was
about sixteen miles north-west of Beneventum, and on the site of the
modern Cerreto. The Comini here mentioned by Pliny, it is thought,
dwelt in neither of the above places. The sites of the towns of many of
the peoples here mentioned are also equally unknown.</p></div>

The river Velinus, now Velino, rising in the Apennines, in the vicinity
of Reate, overflowed its banks and formed several small lakes, the
largest of which was called Lake Velinus, now Pie di Lugo or Lago, while
a smaller one was called Lacus Reatinus, now Lago di Santa Susanna.
In order to carry off these waters, a channel was cut through the rocks
by Curius Dentatus, the conqueror of the Sabines, by means of which
the waters of the Velinus were carried through a narrow gorge to a spot
where they fall from a height of several hundred feet into the river
Nar. This fall is now known as the Fall of Terni or the Cascade Delle
Marmore.</p></div>

A Sabine divinity said to have been identical with Victory. The
Romans however made her the goddess of leisure and repose, and represented
her as being worshiped by the husbandmen at harvest home,
when they were “vacui,” or at leisure. She is mentioned by Ovid in the
Fasti, B. vi. l. 307. The grove here alluded to was one of her sanctuaries.</p></div>

This was a town of the Sabines between Reate and Interocrea, in the
vicinity of a small lake of the same name. It was a mere pool, according
to Dionysius, being but 400 feet in diameter. It is supposed that the
floating island was formed from the incrustations of carbonate of lime on
the banks, which, becoming detached, probably collected in the middle.
The lake still exists, but the floating island has disappeared. There are
some fine ruins of Roman baths in the vicinity of the lake.</p></div>

It was a custom with the early Italian nations, especially the Sabines,
in times of danger and distress, to vow to the deity the sacrifice of all the
produce of the ensuing spring, that is, of the period from the first day of
March till the last day of April. It is probable that in early times human
sacrifices were the consequence; but at a later period the following
custom was adopted instead. The children were allowed to grow up, and
in the spring of their twentieth or twenty-first year were with covered
faces driven across the frontier of their native country, to go whithersoever
chance or the guidance of the deity might lead them. The Mamertini
in Sicily were said to have had this origin.</p></div>

an inscription giving notice that whoever should pass in arms into the
Roman territory would be deemed an enemy to the state. It is especially

We shall find Pliny again mentioning it in B. xiv. c. 6, as famous for the

This passage, “while others make it 225,” is omitted in many of
the MSS. and most of the editions. If it is retained, it is not improbable
that his meaning is, “and the circumference of Liburnia which joins
it, with the Flanatic Gulf, some make 225, while others make the compass
of Liburnia to be 180 miles.” It depends on the punctuation and
the force of “item,” and the question whether the passage is not in a
corrupt state; and it is not at all clear what his meaning really is.</p></div>

The Romans are said to have changed its Greek name Epidamnum,
from an idea that it was inauspicious, as implying “damnum” or “ruin.”
It has been asserted that they gave it the name of Durrhachium or Dyrrhachium,
from “durum,” rugged, on account of the ruggedness of its
locality. This however cannot be the case, as the word, like its predecessor,
is of Greek origin. Its unfortunate name, “Epidamnus,” is the
subject of several puns and witticisms in that most amusing perhaps of all
the plays of Plautus, the Menæchmi. It was of Corcyræan origin, and
after playing a distinguished part in the civil wars between Pompey and
Cæsar, was granted by Augustus to his veteran troops. The modern
Durazzo stands on its site.</p></div>

Ajasson remarks here that the name of Illyricum was very vaguely
used by the ancients, and that at different periods, different countries
were so designated. In Pliny’s time that region comprised the country
between the Arsia and the mouth of the Drilo, bounding it on the side
of Macedonia. It would thus comprehend a part of modern Carniola,
with part of Croatia, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and Upper Albania. In later
times this name was extended to Noricum, Pannonia, Mœsia, Dacia,
Macedonia, Thessalia, Achaia, Epirus, and even the Isle of Crete.</p></div>

Here meaning that part of the Mediterranean which lies between
Italy and Greece south of the Adriatic. In more ancient times the

islands on the western coast of Greece.</p></div>

More properly “Diomedeæ,” being a group of small islands off the
coast of Apulia now called Isole di Tremiti, about eighteen miles from
the mouth of the Fortore. They were so called from the fable that here
the companions of Diomedes were changed into birds. A species of sea-fowl
(which Pliny mentions in B. x. c. 44) were said to be the descendants
of these Greek sailors, and to show a great partiality for such
persons as were of kindred extraction. See Ovid’s Metamorphoses,
B. xiv. l. 500. The real number of these islands was a matter of dispute
with the ancients, but it seems that there are but three, and some mere
rocks. The largest of the group is the island of San Domenico, and the
others are San Nicola and Caprara. The small island of Pianosa, eleven
miles N.E., is not considered one of the group, but is not improbably
the Teutria of Pliny. San Domenico was the place of banishment of Julia,
the licentious daughter of Augustus.</p></div>

In B. xxxvii. c. 11, he again mentions this circumstance, and states
that some writers have placed them in the Adriatic opposite the mouths
of the Padus. Scymnus of Chios makes mention of them in conjunction
with the Absyrtides. This confusion probably arose from the fact previously
noted that the more ancient writers had a confused idea that the
Ister communicated with the Adriatic, at the same time mistaking it probably
for the Vistula, which flows into the Baltic. At the mouth of this
last-mentioned river, there were Electrides or “amber-bearing” islands.</p></div>

no islands called Celadussæ, and that the name in Pliny is a corruption of
Dyscelados in Pomponius Mela; which in its turn is supposed to have been
invented from what was really an epithet of Issa, in a line of Apollonius
Rhodius, B. iv. l. 565. <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἰσσά τε δυσκέλαδος</span>, “and inauspicious Issa.”

He constructed many public works at Rome, and among them the Pantheon;
he also built the splendid aqueduct at Nismes. He died suddenly
in his 51st year. His body was buried in the Mausoleum of Augustus,
who pronounced his funeral oration. He wrote memoirs of his own life.
Pliny often refers to the “Commentarii” of Agrippa, by which are meant,
it is supposed, certain official lists drawn up by him in the measurement
of the Roman world under Augustus. His map of the world is also

the Nature of the Gods, an account of the Penates, an account of Virgil
(probably the same as the work called “Commentaries on Virgil”), on the
Families of Trojan descent, on Agriculture, the “Propempticon Cinnæ,”

that he was worthy of the empire. This, with his riches and talents,
rendered him an object of suspicion to Tiberius. Being charged as an
accomplice in the crimes of Albucilla, he put himself to death by opening
his veins. It appears not to be certain whether it was this person or his
father who wrote a history of the first Punic war, in which he imitated
the style of Sallust.</p></div>

In most editions this name appears as L. Ateius Capito, but Sillig
separates them, and with propriety it would appear, as the name of
Capito the great legist was not Lucius. Ateius here mentioned was
probably the person surnamed Prætextatus, and Philologus, a freedman
of the jurist Ateius Capito. For Sallust the historian he composed an
Abstract of Roman History, and for Asinius Pollio he compiled precepts
on the Art of Writing. His Commentaries were numerous, but a few
only were surviving in the time of Suetonius.</p></div>

C. Ateius Capito, one of the most famous of the Roman legists, and
a zealous partisan of Augustus, who had him elevated to the Consulship
<span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 5. He was the rival of Labeo, the republican jurist. His legal
works were very voluminous, and extracts from them are to be found in

Caius and Lucius Cæsar. He died at an advanced age in the reign of
Tiberius. He wrote upon antiquities, history, and philosophy: among
his numerous works a History of the Etruscans is mentioned, also a
treatise on Orthography. Pliny quotes him very frequently.</p></div>

Also called by Pliny Cornelius Alexander. Suidas states that he
was a native of Ephesus and a disciple of Crates, and during the war of
Sylla in Greece was made prisoner and sold as a slave to C. Lentulus, who
made him the tutor of his children, and afterwards restored him to freedom.
Servius however says that he received the franchise from L. Cornelius
Sylla. He was burnt with his house at Laurentum. Other writers
say that he was a native of Catiæum in Lesser Phrygia. The surname of
“Polyhistor” was given to him for his prodigious learning. His greatest
work seems to have been a historical and geographical account of the
world, in forty-two books. Other works of his are frequently mentioned
by Plutarch, Photius, and other writers.</p></div>

He is frequently mentioned by Cicero, and was famous for his eloquence.
Pliny informs us in his 34th book, that from his hatred of the
Romans he was called the “Roman-hater.” It is probable that he was
the writer of a Periegesis, or geographical work, from which Pliny seems
to quote.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

Diodorus Siculus was a native of Agyra or Agyrium, and not of
Syracuse, though he may possibly have resided or studied there. It cannot
be doubted that he is the person here meant, and Pliny refers in his
preface by name to his <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Βιβλιοθήκη</span>, “Library,” or Universal History.
A great portion of this miscellaneous but valuable work has perished.
We have but few particulars of his life; but he is supposed to have
written his work after <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 8.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2080" href="#FNanchor_2080" class="label">2080</a>
Of Syracuse; an historian probably of the time of Philip and Alexander.
He was the author of a Periplus of Asia, and an account of Sicily

Probably Timagenes, the rhetorician of Alexandria. He was taken
prisoner and brought to Rome, but redeemed from captivity by Faustus,
the son of Sylla. He wrote many works, but it is somewhat doubtful
whether the “Periplus,” in five Books, was written by this Timagenes. He
is also supposed to have written a work on the Antiquities of Gaul.</p></div>

This country contained, according to Pouqueville, the present Sangiacs
of Janina, Delvino, and Chamouri, with the Vavodilika or Principality
of Arta. This name was originally given to the whole of the west of
Greece, from the Promontory of Acroceraunia to the entrance of the Corinthian

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2095" href="#FNanchor_2095" class="label">2095</a>
The country about Dodona is called Hellopia by Hesiod. By some
the Helli or Hellopes are considered the same as the Selli. Pouqueville
thinks that the Hellopes dwelt in the modern cantons of Janina, Pogoniani,
Sarachovitzas, and Courendas, and that the temple of Jupiter stood
at the spot now called Proskynisis, near Gardiki, the town of Dodona
being near Castritza. Leake is of the same opinion as to the site of the
town; but, as has been a subject of remark, it is the only place of celebrity
in Greece of which the situation is not exactly known. Leake however
thinks that the temple stood on the peninsula now occupied by the
citadel of Joanina.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2096" href="#FNanchor_2096" class="label">2096</a>
Pouqueville thinks that this is the hill to be seen at the modern village

Pouqueville has shown that Pliny is in error here, and he says that
the Acheron is the modern Mavro Potamos; but according to Leake,
the name of it is Gurla, or the river of Suli. It flows into the Port Fanari,
formerly called Glykys Limen, or Sweet Harbour, from the freshness
of the water there. The Acherusian Lake is probably the great
marsh that lies below Kastri.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

Now the island of Santa Maura. It was originally a peninsula, and

Smith (<em>Journal of Royal Geogr. Soc.</em> vol. vii. p. 65) we learn that its

its circumference must be greatly exaggerated. Juvenal, Sat. x. l. 174,
mentions the story of the canal as a specimen of Greek falsehood; but
distinct traces have survived, to be seen by modern travellers, all the way
from the Gulf of Monte Santo to the Bay of Erso in the Gulf of Contessa,

It has been remarked, that Pliny is mistaken here if he intends to

The loftiest point of the mountain-range that traverses the island of
Crete from west to east. Its head is covered with snow. The modern
name is Psiloriti, looking down on the plain of Mesara. The word <em>Ida</em>
is supposed to mean a mountain in which mines are worked, and the
Idæi Dactyli of Crete were probably among the first workers in iron and
bronze. The position of Mount Cadistus, belonging to the range of
White Mountains, has been fixed by Hoeck at Cape Spadha, the most
northerly point of the island. It is thought that Pliny and Solinus are
in error in speaking of Cadistus and Dictynnæus as separate peaks,
these being, both of them, names of the mountain of which the cape was
formed; the latter name having been given in later times, from the
worship and temple there of Dictynna.</p></div>

One of the most powerful cities of Eubœa. It was destroyed by the
Persians under Darius, and a new town was built to the south of the old
one. New Eretria stood, according to Leake, at the modern Kastri, and
old Eretria in the neighbourhood of Vathy. The tragic poet Achæus, a
contemporary of Æschylus, was born here; and a school of philosophy
was founded at this place by Menedemus, a disciple of Plato.</p></div>

into that bird by Jupiter, in order to effect her escape thither from the anger
of Juno. Its name of Asteria was derived from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄστρον</span>, “a star,” either
in consequence of its being devoted to the worship of the great luminary
Apollo, or of its being considered by the gods the star of the earth. It was
also called Lagia, from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">λαγὼς</span>, “a hare,” that animal abounding there;

Now Nio, one of the Sporades, inaccurately called by Stephanus one
of the Cyclades. The modern town is built on the site of the ancient
one, of which there are some remains. It was said that Homer died
here, on his voyage from Smyrna to Athens, and that his mother,
Clymene, was a native of this island. In 1773, Van Krienen, a Dutch
nobleman, asserted that he had discovered the tomb of Homer here, with
certain inscriptions relative to him; but they have been generally regarded
by the learned as forgeries. Odia and Oletandros seem not to

Near Naxos. Virgil calls it ‘viridis,’ or ‘green,’ which Servius explains
by the colour of its marble. Like Gyara, it was used as a place

Cynæthus as one of the names of Delos.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2730" href="#FNanchor_2730" class="label">2730</a>

<p><a id="Footnote_2734" href="#FNanchor_2734" class="label">2734</a>
Now Kimoli, one of the Cyclades, between Siphnos and Melos. It
took its name of Echinussa from the ‘Echinus,’ or Sea-urchin, of which
various fossil specimens are still found on the coast; but nowhere else in
these islands, except the opposite coast of Melos. There are considerable
ruins of its ancient town.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2735" href="#FNanchor_2735" class="label">2735</a>

<p><a id="Footnote_2739" href="#FNanchor_2739" class="label">2739</a>
Now Santorin, south of the island of Ios. The tradition was, that
it was formed from a clod of earth, thrown from the ship Argo. It is
evidently of volcanic origin, and is covered with pumice-stone. It was
colonized by Lacedæmonians and Minyans of Lemnos, under the Spartan
Theras, who gave his name to the island.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2743" href="#FNanchor_2743" class="label">2743</a>
Now Astropalæa, or Stamphalia. By Strabo it is called one of the
Sporades, by Stephanus one of the Cyclades. It probably was favoured
by the Romans for the excellence and importance of its harbours. From
Hegesander we learn that it was famous for its hares, and Pliny tells us,
in B. viii. c. 59, that its mussels were (as they still are) very celebrated.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2745" href="#FNanchor_2745" class="label">2745</a>
Now Kalymno, the principal island of the group, by Homer called
Calydne. According to most of the editions, Pliny mentions here
Calydna and Calymna, making this island, which had those two names, into
two islands. Although Pliny here mentions only the town of Coös, still,
in B. v. c. <a href="#BOOK_V_CHAP_36">36</a>, he speaks of three others, Notium, Nisyrus, and Mendeterus.
There are still some remains of antiquity to be seen here.</p></div>

Only three of these are now considered of importance, as being the
main branches of the river. It is looked upon as impossible by modern
geographers to identify the accounts given by the ancients with the

very considerable changes at its mouth. Strabo mentions seven mouths,
three being lesser ones.</p></div>

According to Herodotus, this region, called Hylæa, lay to the east of

of this ancient woodland; some of the old maps however give the name
of the “Black Forest” to this district. From the statements of modern
travellers, the woody country does not commence till the river Don has
been reached. The district of Hylæa has been identified by geographers
with the great plain of Janboylouk in the steppe of the Nogai.</p></div>

to whose learning he had been so much indebted for his geographical
information, by applying to him the epithet “imperitus,” ‘ignorant’
or ‘unskilled’; he therefore suggests that the proper reading here is,
“ut non imperiti dixere,” “as some by no means ignorant persons have
asserted.”</p></div>

As the whole of Pliny’s description of the northern shores of Europe
is replete with difficulties and obscurities, we cannot do better than transcribe
the learned remarks of M. Parisot, the Geographical Editor of Ajasson’s
Edition, in reference to this subject. He says, “Before entering on
the discussion of this portion of Pliny’s geography, let us here observe, once
for all, that we shall not remark as worthy of our notice all those ridiculous
hypotheses which could only take their rise in ignorance, precipitation, or
a love of the marvellous. We shall decline then to recognize the Doffrefelds
in the mountains of Sevo, the North Cape in the Promontory of
Rubeas, and the Sea of Greenland in the Cronian Sea. The absurdity
of these suppositions is proved by—I. The impossibility of the ancients
ever making their way to these distant coasts without the aid of large
vessels, the compass, and others of those appliances, aided by which European
skill finds the greatest difficulty in navigating those distant seas.
II. The immense lacunæ which would be found to exist in the descriptions
of these distant seas and shores: for not a word do we find about
those numerous archipelagos which are found scattered throughout the
North Sea, not a word about Iceland, nor about the numberless seas and
fiords on the coast of Norway. III. The absence of all remarks upon
the local phænomena of these spots. The North Cape belongs to the
second polar climate, the longest day there being two months and a half.
Is it likely that navigators would have omitted to mention this remarkable
phænomenon, well known to the Romans by virtue of their astronomical theories, but one
with which practically they had never made themselves
acquainted?—The only geographers who here merit our notice are those
who are of opinion that in some of the coasts or islands here mentioned
Pliny describes the Scandinavian Peninsula, and in others the Coast of
Finland. The first question then is, to what point Pliny first carries us?
It is evident that from the Black Sea he transports himself on a sudden
to the shores of the Baltic, thus passing over at a single leap a considerable
space filled with nations and unknown deserts. The question
then is, what line has he followed? Supposing our author had had before
his eyes a modern map, the imaginary line which he would have drawn
in making this transition would have been from Odessa to the Kurisch-Haff.
In this direction the breadth across Europe is contracted to a
space, between the two seas, not more than 268 leagues in length. A
very simple mode of reasoning will conclusively prove that Pliny has
deviated little if anything from this route. If he fails to state in precise
terms upon what point of the shores of the Baltic he alights after leaving
the Riphæan mountains, his enumeration of the rivers which discharge
themselves into that sea, and with which he concludes his account of
Germany, will supply us with the requisite information, at all events in
great part. In following his description of the coast, we find mention
made of the following rivers, the Guttalus, the Vistula, the Elbe, the Weser,
the Ems, the Rhine, and the Meuse. The five last mentioned follow in
their natural order, from east to west, as was to be expected in a description
starting from the east of Europe for its western extremity and the
shores of Cadiz. We have a right to conclude then that the Guttalus
was to the east of the Vistula. As we shall now endeavour to show,
this river was no other than the Alle, a tributary of the Pregel, which
the Romans probably, in advancing from west to east, considered as the
principal stream, from the circumstance that they met with it, before
coming to the larger river. The Pregel after being increased by the waters
of the Alle or Guttalus falls into the Frisch-Haff, about one degree
further west than the Kurisch-Haff. It may however be here remarked,
Why not find a river more to the east, the Niemen, for instance, or the
Duna, to be represented by the Guttalus? The Niemen in especial would
suit in every respect equally well, because it discharges itself into the
Kurisch-Haff. This conjecture however is incapable of support, when
we reflect that the ancients were undoubtedly acquainted with some
points of the coast to the east of the mouth of the Guttalus, but which,
according to the system followed by our author, would form part of the
Continent of Asia. These points are, 1st. The Cape Lytarmis (mentioned
by Pliny, B. vi. c. 4). 2ndly. The mouth of the river Carambucis
(similarly mentioned by him), and 3rdly, a little to the east of Cape Lytarmis,
the mouth of the Tanais. The name of Cape Lytarmis suggests
to us Lithuania, and probably represents Domess-Ness in Courland; the
Carambucis can be no other than the Niemen; while the Tanais, upon
which so many authors, ancient and modern, have exhausted their conjectures,
from confounding it with the Southern Tanais which falls into
the Sea of Azof, is evidently the same as the Dwina or Western Duna.
This is established incontrovertibly both by its geographical position (the
mouth of the Dwina being only fifty leagues to the east of Domess-Ness)
and the identity evidently of the names Dwina and Tanais. Long since,
Leibnitz was the first to remark the presence of the radical <em>T. n</em>, or <em>D. n</em>,
either with or without a vowel, in the names of the great rivers of Eastern
Europe; Danapris or Dnieper, Danaster or Dniester, Danube (in German
Donau, in Hungarian Duna), Tanais or Don, for example; all
which rivers however discharge themselves into the Black Sea. There
can be little doubt then of the identity of the Duna with the Tanais, it
being the only body of water in these vast countries which bears a name
resembling the initial <em>Tan</em>, or <em>Tn</em>, and at the same time belongs to the
basin of the Baltic. We are aware, it is true, that the White Sea receives
a river Dwina, which is commonly called the Northern Dwina,
but there can be no real necessity to be at the trouble of combating the
opinion that this river is identical with the Northern Tanais. As the
result then of our investigations, it is at the eastern extremity of the
Frisch-Haff and near the mouth of the Pregel, that we would place the
point at which Pliny sets out. As for the Riphæan mountains, they have
never existed anywhere but in the head of the geographers from whom
our author drew his materials. From the mountains of Ural and Poias,
which Pliny could not possibly have in view, seeing that they lie in a
meridian as eastern as the Caspian Sea, the traveller has to proceed 600
leagues to the south-west without meeting with any chains of mountains
or indeed considerable elevations.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2880" href="#FNanchor_2880" class="label">2880</a>
It is pretty clear that he refers to the numerous islands scattered over
the face of the Baltic Sea, such as Dago, Oesel, Gothland, and Aland.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2881" href="#FNanchor_2881" class="label">2881</a>
The old reading here was Bannomanna, which Dupinet would translate
by the modern Bornholm. Parisot considers that the modern Runa,
a calcareous rock covered with vegetable earth, in the vicinity of Domess-Ness,
is the place indicated.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2882" href="#FNanchor_2882" class="label">2882</a>
It has been suggested by Brotier that Pliny here refers to the Icy
Sea, but it is more probable that he refers to the north-eastern part of
the Baltic, which was looked upon by the ancients us forming part of
the open sea.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2883" href="#FNanchor_2883" class="label">2883</a>
With reference to these divisions of land and sea, a subject which is
involved in the greatest obscurity, Parisot states it as his opinion that
the Amalchian or Icy Sea is that portion of the Baltic which extends
from Cape Rutt to Cape Grinea, while on the other hand the Cronian
Sea comprehends all the gulfs which lie to the east of Cape Rutt, such
as the Haff, the gulfs of Stettin and Danzic, the Frisch-Haff, and the Kurisch-Haff.
He also thinks that the name of ‘Cronian’ originally belonged
only to that portion of the Baltic which washes the coast of Courland,
but that travellers gradually applied the term to the whole of the sea.
He is also of opinion that the word “Cronium” owes its origin to the
Teutonic and Danish adjective <em>groen</em> or “green.” The extreme verdure
which characterizes the islands of the Danish archipelago has given to
the piece of water which separates the islands of Falster and Moen the
name of Groensund, and it is far from improbable that the same epithet
was given to the Pomeranian and Prussian Seas, which the Romans would
be not unlikely to call ‘Gronium’ or ‘Cronium fretum,’ or ‘Cronium
mare.’ In the name ‘Parapanisus’ he also discovers a resemblance to that
of modern Pomerania.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2884" href="#FNanchor_2884" class="label">2884</a>
Upon this Parisot remarks that on leaving Cape Rutt, at a distance
of about twenty-five leagues in a straight line, we come to the island of
Funen or Fyen, commonly called Fionia, the most considerable of the
Danish archipelago next to Zealand, and which lying between the two
Belts, the Greater and the Smaller, may very probably from that circumstance
have obtained the name of Baltia. Brotier takes Baltia to
be no other than Nova Zembla—so conflicting are the opinions of commentators!</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2885" href="#FNanchor_2885" class="label">2885</a>
Parisot suggests that under this name may possibly lie concealed
that of the modern island of Zealand or Seeland, and that it may have
borne on the side of it next to the Belt the name of Baltseeland, easily
corrupted by the Greeks into Basilia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2886" href="#FNanchor_2886" class="label">2886</a>
Brotier takes these to be the islands of Aloo, and Bieloi or Ostrow,
at the mouth of the river Paropanisus, which he considers to be the same
as the Obi. Parisot on the other hand is of opinion that islands of the
Baltic are here referred to; that from the resemblance of the name Oönæ
to the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ὠὸν</span>, “an egg,” the story that the natives subsisted on the
eggs of birds was formed; that not improbably the group of the Hippopodes
resembled the shape of a horse-shoe, from which the story mentioned
by Pliny took its rise; and that the Fanesii (or, as the reading here has it, the
Panotii, “all-ears”) wore their hair very short, from which
circumstance their ears appeared to be of a larger size than usual.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2887" href="#FNanchor_2887" class="label">2887</a>
Tacitus speaks of three great groups of the German tribes, the Ingævones
forming the first thereof, and consisting of those which dwelt on
the margin of the ocean, the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istævones
in the east and south of Germany. We shall presently find that Pliny
adds two groups, the Vandili as the fourth, and the Peucini and Basternæ
as the fifth. This classification however is thought to originate in a mistake,
for Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili belonged to the
Hermiones, and that Peucini and Basternæ are only names of individual
tribes and not of groups of tribes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2888" href="#FNanchor_2888" class="label">2888</a>
Brotier and other geographers are of opinion that by this name the
chain of the Doffrefeld mountains is meant; but this cannot be the case
if we suppose with Parisot that Pliny here returns south from the Scandinavian
islands and takes his departure from Cape Rutt in the territory
of the Ingævones. Still, it is quite impossible to say what mountains he
would designate under the name of Sevo. Parisot suggests that it is a form
of the compound word “seevohner,” “inhabitants of the sea,” and that it
is a general name for the elevated lands along the margin of the sea-shore.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2889" href="#FNanchor_2889" class="label">2889</a>
Parisot supposes that under this name the isle of Funen is meant,
but it is more generally thought that Norway and Sweden are thus designated,
as that peninsula was generally looked upon as an island by the
ancients. The Codanian Gulf was the sea to the east of the Cimbrian
Chersonesus or Jutland, filled with the islands which belong to the modern
kingdom of Denmark. It was therefore the southern part of the Baltic.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2890" href="#FNanchor_2890" class="label">2890</a>
By Eningia Hardouin thinks that the country of modern Finland is
meant. Poinsinet thinks that under the name are included Ingria, Livonia,
and Courland; while Parisot seems inclined to be of opinion that
under this name the island of Zealand is meant, a village of which, about
three-fourths of a league from the western coast, according to him, still
bears the name of Heinïnge.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2891" href="#FNanchor_2891" class="label">2891</a>
Parisot is of opinion that the Venedi, also called Vinidæ and Vindili,
were of Sclavish origin, and situate on the shores of the Baltic. He
remarks that this people, in the fifth century, founded in Pomerania, when
quitted by the Goths, a kingdom, the chiefs of which styled themselves
the Konjucs of Vinland. Their name is also to be found in Venden, a
Russian town in the government of Riga, in Windenburg in Courland, and
in Wenden in the circle of the Grand Duchy of Mecklenburg Schwerin.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2892" href="#FNanchor_2892" class="label">2892</a>
Parisot remarks that these two peoples were probably only tribes
of the Venedi.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2893" href="#FNanchor_2893" class="label">2893</a>
Parisot feels convinced that Pliny is speaking here of the Gulf of
Travemunde, the island of Femeren, and then of the gulf which extends
from that island to Kiel, where the Eider separates Holstein from Jutland.
On the other hand, Hardouin thinks that by the Gulf of Cylipenus
the Gulf of Riga is meant, and that Latris is the modern island of
Oësel. But, as Parisot justly remarks, to put this construction on Pliny’s
language is to invert the order in which he has hitherto proceeded, evidently
from east to west.</p></div>

In a straight line, of course. Parisot is of opinion that in forming
this estimate Agrippa began at the angle formed by the river Piave in
lat. 46° 4′, measuring thence to Cape Rubeas (now Rutt) in lat. 54° 25′.
This would give 8° 21′, to which, if we add some twenty leagues for obliquity
or difference of longitude, the total would make exactly the distance
here mentioned.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2902" href="#FNanchor_2902" class="label">2902</a>
As already mentioned, Zeuss has satisfactorily shown that the Vandili
or Vindili properly belonged to the Hermiones. Tacitus mentions
but three groups of the German nations; the Ingævones on the ocean,
the Hermiones in the interior, and the Istævones in the east and south
of Germany. The Vandili, a Gothic race, dwelt originally on the northern
coast of Germany, but afterwards settled north of the Marcomanni on the Riesengebirge.
They subsequently appeared in Dacia and Pannonia, and
in the beginning of the fifth century invaded Spain. Under Genseric they
passed over into Africa, and finally took and plundered Rome in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 455.
Their kingdom was finally destroyed by Belisarius.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2903" href="#FNanchor_2903" class="label">2903</a>
It is supposed that the Burgundiones were a Gothic people dwelling
in the country between the rivers Viadus and Vistula, though Ammianus
Marcellinus declares them to have been of pure Roman origin. How
they came into the country of the Upper Maine in the south-west of
Germany in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 289, historians have found themselves at a loss to inform
us. It is not improbable that the two peoples were not identical,
and that the similarity of their name arose only from the circumstance that
they both resided in “burgi” or burghs. See Gibbon, iii. 99. <em>Bohn’s Ed.</em></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_2904" href="#FNanchor_2904" class="label">2904</a>
The Varini dwelt on the right bank of the Albis or Elbe, north of the
Langobardi. Ptolemy however, who seems to mention them as the Avarini,
speaks of them as dwelling near the sources of the Vistula, on the
site of the present Cracow. See Gibbon, iv. 225. <em>Bohn’s Ed.</em></p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2906" href="#FNanchor_2906" class="label">2906</a>
They are also called in history Gothi, Gothones, Gotones and Gutæ.
According to Pytheas of Marseilles (as mentioned by Pliny, B. xxxvii.
c. 2), they dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, in the vicinity of what is
now called the Fritsch-Haff. Tacitus also refers to the same district,
though he does not speak of them as inhabiting the coast. Ptolemy
again speaks of them as dwelling on the east of the Vistula, and to the
south of the Venedi. The later form of their name, <em>Gothi</em>, does not occur
till the time of Caracalla. Their native name was Gutthinda. They are
first spoken of as a powerful nation at the beginning of the third century,
when we find them mentioned as ‘Getæ,’ from the circumstance of
their having occupied the countries formerly inhabited by the Sarmatian
Getæ. The formidable attacks made by this people, divided into the
nations of the Ostrogoths and Visigoths, upon the Roman power during
its decline, are too well known to every reader of Gibbon to require
further notice.</p></div>

The inhabitants of Chersonesus Cimbrica, the modern peninsula of
Jutland. It seems doubtful whether these Cimbri were a Germanic nation
or a Celtic tribe, as also whether they were the same race whose
numerous hordes successively defeated six Roman armies, and were finally
conquered by C. Marius, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 101, in the Campi Raudii. The more
general impression, however, entertained by historians, is that they were
a Celtic or Gallic and not a Germanic nation. The name is said to have
signified “robbers.” See Gibbon, i. 273, iii. 365. <em>Bohn’s Ed.</em></p></div>

The Teutoni or Teutones dwelt on the coasts of the Baltic, adjacent

to a single nation or tribe, came to be afterwards applied collectively to

Also called Cauchi, Cauci, and Cayci, a German tribe to the east of
the Frisians, between the rivers Ems and Elbe. The modern Oldenburg
and Hanover are supposed to pretty nearly represent the country
of the Chauci. In B. xvi. c. 1. 2, will be found a further account of them
by Pliny, who had visited their country, at least that part of it which lay
on the sea-coast. They are mentioned for the last time in the third century,
when they had extended so far south and west that they are spoken
of as living on the banks of the Rhine.</p></div>

This appears to be properly the collective name of a great number of
the German tribes, who were of a migratory mode of life, and spoken of
in opposition to the more settled tribes, who went under the general name
of Ingævones. Cæsar speaks of them as dwelling east of the Ubii and
Sygambri, and west of the Cherusci. Strabo makes them extend in an
easterly direction beyond the Albis or Elbe, and southerly as far as the
sources of the Danube. Tacitus gives the name of Suevia to the whole
of the east of Germany, from the Danube to the Baltic. The name of
the modern Suabia is derived from a body of adventurers from various
German tribes, who assumed the name of Suevi in consequence of their

A large and powerful tribe of Germany, which occupied the extensive
tract of country between the mountains in the north-west of Bohemia
and the Roman Wall in the south-west, which formed the boundary
of the Agri Decumates. On the east they bordered on the Narisci, on
the north-east on the Cherusci, and on the north-west on the Chatti.
There is little doubt that they originally formed part of the Suevi. At
a later period they spread in a north-easterly direction, taking possession
of the north-western part of Bohemia and the country about the sources
of the Maine and Saale, that is, the part of Franconia as far as Kissingen
and the south-western part of the kingdom of Saxony. The name Hermunduri
is thought by some to signify highlanders, and to be a compound
of <em>Her</em> or <em>Ar</em>, “high,” and <em>Mund</em>, “man.”</p></div>

One of the great tribes of Germany, which rose to importance after
the decay of the power of the Cherusci. It is thought by ethnographers
that their name is still preserved in the word “Hessen.” They formed the
chief tribe of the Hermiones here mentioned, and are described by Cæsar
as belonging to the Suevi, though Tacitus distinguishes them, and no
German tribe in fact occupied more permanently its original locality than
the Chatti. Their original abode seems to have extended from the Westerwald in
the west to the Saale in Franconia, and from the river Maine
in the south as far as the sources of the Elison and the Weser, so that
they occupied exactly the modern country of Hessen, including perhaps
a portion of the north-west of Bavaria. See Gibbon, vol. iii. 99. <em>Bohn’s Ed.</em></p></div>

The Cherusci were the most celebrated of all the German tribes, and
are mentioned by Cæsar as of the same importance as the Suevi, from
whom they were separated by the Silva Bacensis. There is some difficulty
in stating their exact locality, but it is generally supposed that
their country extended from the Visurgis or Weser in the west to the
Albis or Elbe in the east, and from Melibocus in the north to the neighbourhood
of the Sudeti in the south, so that the Chamavi and Langobardi
were their northern neighbours, the Chatti the western, the Hermunduri
the southern, and the Silingi and Semnones their eastern
neighbours. This tribe, under their chief Arminius or Hermann, forming
a confederation with many smaller tribes in <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 9, completely defeated
the Romans in the famous battle of the Teutoburg Forest. In later times
they were conquered by the Chatti, so that Ptolemy speaks of them
only as a small tribe on the south of the Hartz mountain. Their name
afterwards appears, in the beginning of the fourth century, in the confederation
of the Franks.</p></div>

The Peucini are mentioned here, as also by Tacitus, as identical with
the Basternæ. As already mentioned, supposing them to be names for
distinct nations, they must be taken as only names of individual tribes,
and not of groups of tribes. It is generally supposed that their first
settlements in Sarmatia were in the highlands between the Theiss and
the March, whence they passed onward to the lower Danube, as far as
its mouth, where a portion of them, settling in the island of Peuce, obtained
the name of Peucini. In the later geographers we find them
settled between the Tyrus or Dniester, and the Borysthenes or Dnieper,
the Peucini remaining at the mouth of the Danube.</p></div>

The ‘Hercynia Silva,’ Hercynian Forest or Range, is very differently
described by the writers of various ages. The earliest mention of it is
by Aristotle. Judging from the accounts given by Cæsar, Pomponius
Mela, and Strabo, the ‘Hercynia Silva’ appears to have been a general
name for almost all the mountains of Southern and Central Germany,
that is, from the sources of the Danube to Transylvania, comprising the Schwarzwald,
Odenwald, Spessart, Rhön, Thuringer Wald, the Hartz
mountain (which seems in a great measure to have retained the ancient
name), Raube Alp, Steigerwald, Fichtelgebirge, Erzgebirge, and Riesengebirge.
At a later period when the mountains of Germany had become
better known, the name was applied to the more limited range extending
around Bohemia, and through Moravia into Hungary.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_2923" href="#FNanchor_2923" class="label">2923</a>
This island appears to have been formed by the bifurcation of the
Rhine, the northern branch of which enters the sea at Katwyck, a few
miles north of Leyden, by the Waal and the course of the Maas, after it has
received the Waal, and by the sea. The Waal or Vahalis seems to have
undergone considerable changes, and the place of its junction with the
Maas may have varied. Pliny makes the island nearly 100 miles in length,
which is about the distance from the fort of Schenkenschanz, where the
first separation of the Rhine takes place, to the mouth of the Maas. The
name of Batavia was no doubt the genuine name, which is still preserved
in Betuwe, the name of a district at the bifurcation of the Rhine and the
Waal. The Canninefates, a people of the same race as the Batavi, also
occupied the island, and as the Batavi seem to have been in the eastern
part, it is supposed that the Canninefates occupied the western. They
were subdued by Tiberius in the reign of Augustus.</p></div>

The Frisii or Frisones were one of the great tribes of north-western
Germany, properly belonging to the group of the Ingævones. They inhabited
the country about Lake Flevo and other lakes, between the Rhine
and the Ems, so as to be bounded on the south by the Bructeri, and on
the east by the Chauci. Tacitus distinguishes between the Frisii Majores
and Minores, and it is supposed that the latter dwelt on the east of
the canal of Drusus in the north of Holland, and the former between the
rivers Flevus and Amisia, that is, in the country which still bears the
name of Friesland. The Chauci have been previously mentioned.</p></div>

Probably the same as the modern Vlieland (thus partly retaining its
ancient name), an island north of the Texel. The more ancient writers
speak of two main arms, into which the Rhine was divided on entering the territory
of the Batavi, of which the one on the east continued to bear
the name of Rhenus, while that on the west into which the Masa, Maas
or Meuse, flowed, was called Vahalis or Waal. After Drusus, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 12,
had connected the Flevo Lacus or Zuyder-Zee with the Rhine by means
of a canal, in forming which he probably made use of the bed of the
Yssel, we find mention made of three mouths of the Rhine. Of these
the names, as given by Pliny, are, on the west, Helium (the Vahalis of
other writers), in the centre Rhenus, and at the north Flevum; but at
a later period we again find mention made of only two mouths.</p></div>

Also called Æmodæ or Hæmodæ, most probably the islands now

refer the Hæmodæ to the Baltic sea, considering them different from the
Acmodæ here mentioned, while Salmasius on the other hand considers the
Acmodæ or Hæmodæ and the Hebrides as identical. Parisot remarks
that off the West Cape of the Isle of Skye and the Isle of North Uist,
the nearest of the Hebrides to the Shetland islands, there is a vast gulf
filled with islands, which still bears the name of Mamaddy or Maddy,

The opinions as to the identity of ancient Thule have been numerous
in the extreme. We may here mention six:—1. The common, and apparently
the best founded opinion, that Thule is the island of Iceland.
2. That it is either the Ferroe group, or one of those islands. 3. The
notion of Ortelius, Farnaby, and Schœnning, that it is identical with
Thylemark in Norway. 4. The opinion of Malte Brun, that the continental
portion of Denmark is meant thereby, a part of which is to the
present day called Thy or Thyland. 5. The opinion of Rudbeck and of
Calstron, borrowed originally from Procopius, that this is a general
name for the whole of Scandinavia. 6. That of Gosselin, who thinks
that under this name Mainland, the principal of the Shetland Islands, is
meant. It is by no means impossible that under the name of Thule
two or more of these localities may have been meant, by different authors
writing at distant periods and under different states of geographical
knowledge. It is also pretty generally acknowledged, as Parisot remarks,
that the Thule mentioned by Ptolemy is identical with Thylemark
in Norway.</p></div>

existence.</p></div>

Brotier, with many other writers, takes these names to refer to various
parts of the coast of Norway. Scandia he considers to be the same
as Scania, Bergos the modern Bergen, and Nerigos the northern part of
Norway. On the other hand, Gosselin is of opinion that under the name
of Bergos the Scottish island of Barra is meant, and under that of Nerigos,
the island of Lewis, the northern promontory of which is in the old
maps designated by the name of Nary or Nery. Ptolemy makes mention
of an island called Doumna in the vicinity of the Orcades.</p></div>

Pliny, in C. <a href="#BOOK_IV_CHAP_34">34</a>, places the Arrotrebæ, belonging to the Conventus
of Lucus Augusti, about the Promontorium Celticum, which, if not
the same as the Nerium (or Cape Finisterre) of the others, is evidently
in its immediate neighbourhood; but he confuses the whole matter by a very curious
error. He mentions a promontory called Artabrum as
the headland <em>at the N.W. extremity of Spain</em>; the coast on the one side of
it looking to the north and the Gallic Ocean, on the other to the west and
the Atlantic Ocean. But he considers this promontory to be the west
<em>headland of the estuary of the Tagus</em>, and adds, that some called it
<em>Magnum Promontorium</em>, or the “Great Promontory,” and others Olisiponense,
from the city of Olisipo, or Lisbon. He assigns, in fact, all the
west coast of Spain, down to the mouth of the Tagus, to the north
coast, and, instead of being led to detect his error by the resemblance of
name between his Artabrum Promontorium and his Arrotrebæ (the
Artabri of his predecessors, Strabo and Mela), he perversely finds fault
with those who had placed above the promontory Artabrum, a people of
the same name who never were there.</p></div>

From the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">κασσίτερος</span>, “tin.” It is generally supposed that the
“Tin Islands” were the Scilly Isles, in the vicinity of Cornwall. At the
same time the Greek and Roman geographers, borrowing their knowledge
from the accounts probably of the Phœnician merchants, seem to have had
a very indistinct notion of their precise locality, and to have thought them
to be nearer to Spain than to Britain. Thus we find Strabo, in B. iii.,
saying, that “the Cassiterides are ten in number, lying near each other
in the ocean, towards the north <em>from the haven of the Artabri</em>.” From
a comparison of the accounts, it would almost appear that the ancient
geographers confused the Scilly Islands with the Azores, as those, who
enter into any detail, attribute to the Cassiterides the characteristics
almost as much of the Azores and the sea in their vicinity, as of the
Scilly Islands.</p></div>

Or the “Islands of the Blest.” We cannot do better than quote a portion
of the article on this subject in Dr. Smith’s “Dictionary of
Ancient Geography.” “‘Fortunatæ Insulæ’ is one of those geographical
names whose origin is lost in mythic darkness, but which afterwards
came to have a specific application, so closely resembling the old mythical
notion, as to make it almost impossible to doubt that that notion was
based, in part at least, on some vague knowledge of the regions afterwards
discovered. The earliest Greek poetry places the abode of the happy
departed spirits far beyond the entrance of the Mediterranean, at the
extremity of the earth, and upon the shores of the river Oceanus, or in
islands in its midst; and Homer’s poetical description of the place may
be applied almost word for word to those islands in the Atlantic, off the
west coast of Africa, to which the name was given in the historical
period. (Od. iv. l. 563, <em>seq.</em>) ‘There the life of mortals is most easy;
there is no snow, nor winter, nor much rain, but Ocean is ever sending
up the shrill breathing breezes of Zephyrus to refresh men.’ Their delicious
climate, and their supposed identity of situation, marked out the
Canary Islands, the Madeira group, and the Azores, as worthy to represent
the Islands of the Blest. In the more specific sense, however,
the name was applied to the two former groups; while, in its widest
application, it may have even included the Cape de Verde Islands, its
extension being in fact adapted to that of maritime discovery.” Pliny
gives a further description of them in B. vi. c. 37.</p></div>

varies in the MSS. from fifteen to twenty-five miles, and this last is probably

Julius Cæsar, on his visit to the city of Gades, during the Civil War

If Gades was not the same as Tartessus (probably the Tarshish
of Scripture), its exact locality is a question in dispute. Most ancient
writers place it at the mouth of the river Bætis, while others identify
it, and perhaps with more probability, with the city of Carteia, on
Mount Calpe, the Rock of Gibraltar. The whole country west of
Gibraltar was called Tartessis. See B. iii. c. <a href="#BOOK_III_CHAP_3">3</a>.</p></div>

“Red Isle,” so called because it lay under the rays of the setting sun in
the west. It was originally said to be situate off the coast of Epirus,
but was afterwards identified either with Gades or the Balearic islands,
and was at all times believed to be in the distant west. Geryon was

Ateius, surnamed <em>Prætextatus</em>, and also Philologus, which last
name he assumed to indicate his learning, was born at Athens, and was
one of the most celebrated grammarians of Rome, in the latter part of
the first century <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> He was originally a freedman of the jurist Ateius
Capito, by whom he was described as “a rhetorician among grammarians,
and a grammarian among rhetoricians.” He was on terms of intimacy
with Sallust the historian, and Asinius Pollio. It is supposed that he
assisted Sallust in the compilation of his history; but to what extent is
not known. But few of his numerous commentaries were extant even
in the time of Suetonius.</p></div>

trained probably in political knowledge and the military art under
Philopœmen, and was sent, as a prisoner to Rome, with others, to
answer the charge of not aiding the Romans in their war against
Perseus. Here, by great good fortune, he secured the friendship of
Scipio Africanus, with whom he was present at the destruction of Carthage.

and Attalus II. In his grammatical system he made a strong distinction

as quite subordinate to the former. Of his learned commentaries
on the Iliad and the Odyssey, only a few fragments have come down

Scyros be an exception, he was the first author of a philosophical treatise

It seems impossible to say which, out of the vast number of the
authors who bore this name, is the one here referred to. It is not improbable
that Dionysius of Chalcis, a Greek historian who lived before
the Christian era, is meant. He wrote a work on the Foundation of
Towns, in five books, which is frequently referred to by the ancients. It
is not probable that the author of the Periegesis, or “Description of the
World,” is referred to, as that book bears internal marks of having been
compiled in the third or fourth century of the Christian era.</p></div>

The modern Tangier occupies its site. It was said to have derived its name
from Tinge, the wife of Antæus, the giant, who was slain by
Hercules. His tomb, which formed a hill, in the shape of a man
stretched out at full length, was shown near the town of Tingis to a
late period. It was also believed, that whenever a portion of the earth
covering the body was taken away, it rained until the hole was filled up
again. Sertorius is said to have dug away a portion of the hill; but, on
discovering a skeleton sixty cubits in length, he was struck with horror,
and had it immediately covered again. Procopius says, that the fortress
of this place was built by the Canaanites, who were driven by the Jews
out of Palestine.</p></div>

be called “Traducta Julia,” or “the removed Colony of Julia,” in remembrance
of a colony having proceeded thence to Spain in the time of
Julius Cæsar. Claudius himself, as stated in the text, established a

D’Anville suggests that it may be Old Mahmora, on the coast; but, on
the other hand, Ptolemy places it among the <em>inland</em> cities, assigning to
it a longitude at some distance from the sea. Pliny also appears to
make it inland, and makes its distance from Lixos seventy-five miles,
while he makes the mouth of the Subur to be fifty miles from the

Like others of the ancient writers, Pliny falls into the error of considering
Atlas, not as an extensive chain of mountains, but as an isolated
mountain, surrounded by sands. With reference to its height, the whole

Morocco reaching near 13,000 feet, in Tunis not 5000.</p></div>

More usually, there is but one Ægipan mentioned,—the son, according
to Hyginus, of Zeus or Jupiter, and a goat,—or of Zeus and Æga, the
wife of Pan. As a foundation for one part of the stories here mentioned,
Brotier suggests the fact, that as the Kabyles, or mountain tribes,
are in the habit of retiring to their dwellings and reposing during the
heat of the day, it would not, consequently, be improbable that they
would devote the night to their amusements, lighting up fires, and
dancing to the music of drums and cymbals.</p></div>

Under his name we still possess a “Periplus,” or account of a
voyage round a part of Libya. The work was originally written in
Punic, but what has come down to us is a Greek translation. We fail,
however, to discover any means by which to identify him with any one
of the many Carthaginians of the same name. Some writers call
him king, and others <em>dux</em>, or <em>imperator</em> of the Carthaginians; from
which we may infer, that he held the office of <em>suffetes</em>. This expedition
has by some been placed as far back as the time of the Trojan war, or of
Hesiod, while others again place it as late as the reign of Agathocles.
Falconer, Bougainville, and Gail, place the time of Hanno at about
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 570, while other critics identify him with Hanno, the father or son

Claudius, in the year <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 42, he defeated the Mauri who had risen in
revolt, and advanced, as Pliny here states, as far as Mount Atlas. It is
not known from what point Paulinus made his advance towards the Atlas
range. Mannert and Marcus are of opinion that he set out from Sala,
the modern Sallee, while Latreille, Malte Brun, and Walkenaer think
that his point of departure was the mouth of the river Lixos. Sala was

D’Anville and Ansart, and Algiers according to others. It is suggested
by Marcus that the name Iol is derived from the Arabic verb <em>galla</em>, “to
be noble” or “famous.” There is no doubt that the magnificent ruins
at Zershell are those of Iol, and that its name is an abbreviation of
Cæsarea Iol.</p></div>

Mannert and others identify it with Scherchell or Zershell, thus placing
it too far west. Mannert was evidently misled by an error in the Antonine
Itinerary, whereby all the places along this coast are, for a considerable
distance, thrown too far to the west; the researches however
which followed the French conquest of the country have revealed inscriptions
which completely set the question at rest.</p></div>

This colony was first established by Caius Gracchus, who sent 6000
settlers to found on the site of Carthage the new city of Junonia. The
Roman senate afterwards annulled this with the other acts of
Gracchus. Under Augustus however the new city of Carthage was
founded, which, when Strabo wrote, was as prosperous as any city in
Africa. It was made, in place of Utica, which had favoured the Pompeian
party, the seat of the proconsul of Old Africa. It stood on the
peninsula terminated by Ras-Sidi-Bou-Said, Cape Carthage or Carthagena.

under the high-sounding name, as we gather from inscriptions, of <em>Colonia
Concordia Ulpia Trajana Augusta Frugifera Hadrumetana</em>, or, as set
forth on coins, <em>Colonia Concordia Julia Hadrumetana Pia</em>. The epithet
<em>Frugifera</em> refers to the fact that it was one of the chief sea-ports for the
corn-producing country of Byzacium. It was destroyed by the Vandals,
but restored by the Emperor Justinian under the name of Justiniana or

Africa, whereas it is pretty clear that he is speaking of the dangers which
attend those who approach it by the line of the sea-coast, as Cato did, on
his march to Utica, so beautifully described by Lucan in his Ninth Book.

In the stricter sense however, and in which the term must be here understood,
the name ‘Garamantes’ denoted the people of Phazania, the modern
Fezzan, which forms by far the largest oasis in the Grand Desert

the account given by Herodotus of the tribes of Northern Africa, has
transferred to the Augylæ what that author really says of the Nasamones.
This oasis forms one of the chief stations on the caravan route from Cairo
to Fezzan. It is placed by Rennell in 30° 3′ North Lat. and 22° 46′ East
Long., 180 miles south-east of Barca, 180 west by north of Siwah, the

“Men of sea complexion,” is the meaning of this Greek name. According
to Marcus they dwelt between the Greater Leptis and the Lake
Tritonis, at the present day called Schibkah-el-Loudeah. For a further

Two brothers, citizens of Carthage, who in a dispute as to their respective
territories with the people of Cyrene, submitted to be buried
alive in the sand, at the boundary-line between the two countries. Sallust
(Jugurthine War) is the main authority for the story. It is also
related by Pomponius Mela, B. i. c. 7, and Valerius Maximus, B. v. c. 6,
but from the Greek name of the brothers, meaning “lovers of praise,” it
is doubtful whether the story is not of spurious origin.</p></div>

Previously called Hesperis or Hesperides. It was the most westerly
city of Cyrenaica, and stood just beyond the eastern extremity of the
Greater Syrtis, on a promontory called Pseudopenias, and near the river
Lethon. Its historical importance only dates from the times of the
Ptolemies, when it was named Berenice, after the wife of Ptolemy III.
or Euergetes. Having been greatly reduced, it was fortified anew by the
Emperor Justinian. Its ruins are to be seen at the modern Ben Ghazi.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3418" href="#FNanchor_3418" class="label">3418</a>

Its ruins may still be seen at Tolmeita or Tolometa. It was situate

Its ruins are still to be seen, bespeaking its former splendour, at the

under the Ptolemies it flourished to such an extent as to eclipse that
city. It is pretty certain that it was the Sozusa of the later Greek writers.
Eratosthenes was a native of this place.</p></div>

The chief city of Cyrenaica, and the most important Hellenic colony
in Africa, the early settlers having extensively intermarried with wives of
Libyan parentage. In its most prosperous times it maintained an extensive
commerce with Greece and Egypt, especially in silphium or
assafœtida, the plantations of which, as mentioned in the present chapter,
extended for miles in its vicinity. Great quantities of this plant were
also exported to Capua in Southern Italy, where it was extensively
employed in the manufacture of perfumes. The scene of the ‘Rudens,’
the most picturesque (if we may use the term) of the plays of Plautus, is
laid in the vicinity of Cyrene, and frequent reference is made in it to the
extensive cultivation of silphium; a head of which plant also appears on
the coins of the place. The philosophers Aristippus and Carneades were
born here, as also the poet Callimachus. Its ruins, at the modern
Ghrennah, are very extensive, and are indicative of its former splendour.</p></div>

Greeks that found the fabled gardens of the Hesperides in the fertile regions
of Cyrenaica. Scylax distinctly mentions the gardens and the lake
of the Hesperides in this vicinity, where we also find a people called
Hesperidæ, or, as Herodotus names them, Euesperidæ. It was probably
in consequence of this similarity of name, in a great degree, that the
gardens of the Hesperides were assigned to this locality.</p></div>

So called from the peculiar features of the locality, the Greek word
<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">καταβαθμὸς</span>, signifying “a descent.” A deep valley, bounded east and
west by ranges of high hills, runs from this spot to the frontiers of
Egypt. It is again mentioned by Pliny at the end of the present
Chapter. The spot is still known by a similar name, being called Marsa
Sollern, or the “Port of the Ladder.” In earlier times the Egyptian
territory ended at the Gulf of Plinthinethes, now Lago Segio, and did not
extend so far as Catabathmos.</p></div>

of the Danube. It was a general name applied by the Greek geographers

This spring is also mentioned by Pliny in B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_106">106</a>. Marcus suggests
that the Debris of Pliny is the same as the Bedir of Ptolemy. He
also remarks that the English traveller Oudney discovered caverns hewn
out of the sides of the hills, evidently for the purposes of habitation, but
of which the use is not known by the present people. These he considers
to have been the abodes of the ancient Troglodytæ or “cave-dwellers.”
In the Tibesti range of mountains, however, we find a race
called the Rock Tibboos, from the circumstance of their dwelling in caves.</p></div>

On the occasion of a triumph by a Roman general, boards were

of vanquished nations and countries. Here too models were exhibited in
ivory or wood of the cities and forts captured, and pictures of the mountains,
rivers, and other great natural features of the subjugated region,
with appropriate inscriptions. Marcus is of opinion that the names of
the places here mentioned do not succeed in any geographical order, but
solely according to their presumed importance as forming part of the
conquest of Balbus. He also thinks that Balbus did not penetrate
beyond the fifteenth degree of north latitude, and that his conquests did
not extend so far south as the banks of Lake Tchad.</p></div>

Clapperton, and Oudney, forming a portion of the chain of Guriano

The Mareotis of the time of the Ptolemies extended from Alexandria
to the Gulf of Plinthinethes; and Libya was properly that portion of
territory which extended from that Gulf to Catabathmos. Pliny is in
error here in confounding the two appellations, or rather, blending them
into one. It includes the eastern portion of the modern Barca, and the
western division of Lower Egypt. It most probably received its name
from the Lake Mareotis, and not the lake from it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3462" href="#FNanchor_3462" class="label">3462</a>
This was a seaport town on the northern coast of Africa, probably
about eleven or twelve miles west of Parætonium, sometimes spoken of
as belonging to Egypt, sometimes to Marmorica. Scylax places it at the
western boundary of Egypt, on the frontier of the Marmaridæ. Ptolemy,
like Pliny, speaks of it as being in the Libyan Nomos. The distances
given in the MSS. of Pliny of this place from Parætonium are seventy-two,
sixty-two, and twelve miles; the latter is probably the correct
reading, as Strabo, B. xvii., makes the distance 100 stadia. It is extremely
doubtful whether the Apis mentioned by Herodotus, B. ii. c. 18, can be
the same place: but there is little doubt, from the words of Pliny here,
that it was dedicated to the worship of the Egyptian god Apis, who was
represented under the form of a bull.</p></div>

In the former editions the word “Aræ” is taken to refer to the
Ægimuri, as meaning the same islands. Sillig is however of opinion
that totally distinct groups are meant, and punctuates accordingly. The
“Aræ” were probably mere rocks lying out at sea, which received their
name from their fancied resemblance to altars. They are mentioned by
Virgil in the Æneid, B. i. l. 113, upon which lines Servius says, that they
were so called because there the Romans and the people of Africa on
one occasion made a treaty.</p></div>

Or “White Æthiopians,” men though of dark complexion, not

refer to the tract of desert country lying between the Leucæthiopians and
the Liby-Egyptians, and not to that between the Gætulians on the one
hand and the Liby-Egyptians and the Leucæthiopians on the other.</p></div>

Marcus is of opinion that Pliny does not here refer to the Joliba of
Park and other travellers, as other commentators have supposed; but
that he speaks of the river called Zis by the modern geographers, and
which Jackson speaks of as flowing from the south-east towards north-west.
The whole subject of the Niger is however enwrapped in almost impenetrable
obscurity, and as the most recent inquirers have not come to any
conclusion on the subject, it would be little more than a waste of time
and space to enter upon an investigation of the notions which Pliny and
Mela entertained on the subject.</p></div>

The more ancient geographers bring them as far westward as the region
beyond the Libyan Desert, and into the vicinity of the Oases. In the

Evidently intended to be derived from the Greek <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἱμὰς</span> “a thong,”
and <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">πόδες</span> “the feet.” It is most probable that the name of a savage
people in the interior bore a fancied resemblance to this word, upon
which the marvellous story here stated was coined for the purpose of
tallying with the name. From a statement in the Æthiopica of Heliodorus,
B. x., Marcus suggests that the story as to the Blemmyæ having
no heads arose from the circumstance, that on the invasion of the Persians
they were in the habit of falling on one knee and bowing the head
to the breast, by which means, without injury to themselves, they
afforded a passage to the horses of the enemy.</p></div>

The capital of this nome was Heracleopolis, ‘The city of Hercules,’

Arsinoïtes, formed by the Nile and a canal. After Memphis
and Heliopolis, it was probably the most important city south of the
Thebaid. Its ruins are inconsiderable; a portion of them are to be seen

<p><a id="Footnote_3514" href="#FNanchor_3514" class="label">3514</a>
He probably means Arsinoë or Arsinoïtis, the chief town of the
nome of that name, and the city so called at the northern extremity of
the Heroöpolite Gulf in the Red Sea. The former is denoted by the
modern district of El-Fayoom, the most fertile of ancient Egypt. At
this place the crocodile was worshipped. The Labyrinth and Lake
Mœris were in this nome. Extensive ruins at Medinet-el-Fayoom, or
El-Fares, represent its site. The modern Ardscherud, a village near
Suez, corresponds to Arsinoë on the Red Sea. There is some little doubt

that it was formed by artificial means is now pretty generally
exploded, and it is regarded as of natural formation. It was situate in
the nome of Arsinoïtes or Crocodilopolites. Its length seems to be overstated

The ethnographer Jablonski is of opinion that this river derives its name

leaves after each inundation. Singularly enough, Champollion prefers

Djebel-Kumri, though at the same time it is more than doubtful that
the Nile has its source in either of those localities, the former especially.</p></div>

Syene was a city of Upper Egypt, on the eastern bank of the Nile just below
the First Cataract, and was looked upon as the southern
frontier city of Egypt against Æthiopia. It was an important point in
the geography and astronomy of the ancients; for, lying just under the
tropic of Cancer, it was chosen as the place through which they drew
their chief parallel of latitude. The sun was vertical to Syene at the
time of the summer solstice, and a well was shown there where the face
of the sun was seen at noon at that time. Its present name is Assouan
or Ossouan.</p></div>

One of these (if indeed Philæ did consist of more than a single

<p><a id="Footnote_3545" href="#FNanchor_3545" class="label">3545</a>
This island was seated just below the Lesser Cataract, opposite Syene,
and near the western bank of the Nile. At this point the river becomes
navigable downward to its mouths, and the traveller from Meroë or
Æthiopia enters Egypt Proper. The original name of this island was
“Ebo,” Eb being in the language of hieroglyphics the symbol of the elephant
and ivory. It was remarkable for its fertility and verdure, and
the Arabs of the present day designate the island as Djesiret-el-Sag, or
“the Blooming.”</p></div>

There was the Greater Apollinopolis, the modern Edfoo, in the
Thebaid, on the western bank of the Nile, in lat. 25° north, about thirteen
miles below the lesser Cataract: its inhabitants were enemies of the crocodile
and its worshippers. The remains of two temples there are considered
second only to the temple of Denderah as specimens of the sacred
structures of Egypt. A Lesser Apollinopolis was in Upper Egypt, on
the western bank of the Nile, in lat. 27° north. Another Lesser Apollinopolis
was a town of the Thebaid in the Coptite Nome, in lat. 26°
north, situate between Thebes and Coptos. It was situate at the present

Its hieroglyphical name was Kobto, and its site is now occupied by
the modern town of Kouft or Keft. It was situate in lat. 26° north,
on the right bank of the Nile, about a mile from its banks. As a halting
place or rather watering-place for the caravans, it was enriched by the
commerce between Libya and Egypt on the one hand, and Arabia and
India and Egypt on the other, the latter being carried on through the
port of Berenice on the Red Sea, founded by Ptolemy Philadelphus,
<span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 266. In the seventh century of the Christian era, it bore for some

Also called Aphrodite or Aphroditopolis. Of this name there
were several towns or cities in ancient Egypt. In Lower Egypt there
was Atarbechis, thus named, and a town mentioned by Strabo in the
nome of Leontopolites. In the Heptanomis or Middle Egypt there was the place, the ruins
of which are called Aftyeh, on the east side of the
Nile, and the capital of the nome of Aphroditopolites. In Upper Egypt
or the Thebais there was the present Tachta, on the west side of the Nile,
between Ptolemais and Panopolis, capital of another nome of Aphroditopolites,
and that one the ruins of which are now called Deir, on the west

are now known as Arábat-el-Matfoon. It was the chief town of the
Nomos Thinites, and was situate in lat. 26° 10′ north and long. 32° 3′
east. In the Thebaid it ranked next to Thebes itself. Here according
to general belief was the burial-place of Osiris. In the time of Strabo it
had sunk into a mere village. Its ruins, though nearly buried in the
sand, are very extensive. There is, however, some uncertainty as to the

the Hermopolite nome in the Heptanomis. It was a place of great
opulence and densely populated. The deities Typhon and Thoth were
principally worshipped at this place. The latter, the inventor of the

most important city north of the Thebaid. It furnished two dynasties

Heliopolis or Rameses. In Scripture it is called by the names
of On and No—Gen. xli. 45 and Ezek. xxx. 15. It stood on the
eastern side of the Pelusiac arm of the Nile, near the right bank of
the Great Canal which connected the river with the Red Sea, and close
adjoining to the present overland route for travellers to India. It was
one of the most ancient of the Egyptian cities; here the father-in-law of Joseph
exercised the office of high-priest, and here the prophet Jeremiah
is supposed to have written his Book of Lamentations. Its priests were
the great depositaries of the theological and historical learning of Egypt.
Solon, Thales, and Plato were reputed each to have visited its schools.
According to Macrobius, Baalbec, the Syrian City of the Sun, was a
colony from this place. It was the capital of the nome Heliopolites,
and paid worship to the sun and the bull Mnevis, the rival of Apis.
From Josephus we learn that after the dispersion and fall of the tribes
of Judah and Israel, great numbers of the Jews took refuge at this place,
forming almost one-half of its population. The ruins, which were extremely
magnificent, occupied in the twelfth century an area nearly three
miles in extent. Pliny speaks of the great obelisk there, which is still
standing. (See B. xxxvi. c. 9.) The village of Matarieh occupies a part
of its site, and besides the obelisk of red granite, there are a few remains
of the Temple of the Sun.</p></div>

One of these was a city of the Philistines, assigned to the tribe of
Judah in the fifteenth Chapter of Joshua, 45, according to the Septuagint
version, but omitted in the Hebrew, which only mentions it in 2 Chron. xxvi. 6
(where it is called Jabneh in the English version), as one
of the cities of the Philistines taken and destroyed by King Uzziah. The
place of this name that lay in the interior, is probably the one spoken of
by Josephus as in that part of the tribe of Judah occupied by the children
of Dan, as also in the 1 Maccabees, x. 69-71. The one was probably the
port of the other. The ruins of the port still retain the name of Yebora,

It is mentioned several times in the New Testament in connection with
Saint Peter. In the Jewish war, having become a refuge for pirates, it
was taken by Cestius and destroyed, and even the very ruins were demolished
by Vespasian. It was afterwards rebuilt, and in the time of the

The site of the Turris Stratonis was afterwards occupied by Cæsarea,
a city on the coast, founded by Herod the Great, and named Cæsarea in
honour of Augustus Cæsar. It was renowned for the extent and magnificence
of its harbour, which was secured by a breakwater of stupendous
construction. For some time it was considered the principal city of
Palestine and the chief seat of the Roman government. Although it
again changed its name, as Pliny states, it still retained its name of
Cæsarea as the Metropolitan See of the First Palestine. It was also of
considerable importance during the occupation of the Holy Land by the
Crusaders. Its ruins are still visible, but have served as a quarry for
many generations, and Jaffa, Sidon, Acre and Beyrout have been supplied
with stones from this site. Massive remains of its mole or breakwater

The Essenes, or Hessenes. These properly formed one of the great
sects into which the Jews were divided in the time of Christ. They are
not mentioned by name in the New Testament, but it has been conjectured
that they are alluded to in Matt. xix. 12, and Col. ii. 18, 23.
As stated here by Pliny, they generally lived at a distance from large
towns, in communities which bore a great resemblance to the monkish
societies of later times. They sent gifts to the Temple at Jerusalem,
but never offered sacrifices there. They were divided into four classes,
according to the time of their initiation. Their origin is uncertain.
Some writers look upon them as the same as the Assidians, or
Chasidim, mentioned in 1 Maccabees, ii. 42, vii. 13. Their principal
society was probably the one mentioned by Pliny, and from this other
smaller ones proceeded, and spread over Palestine, Syria, and Egypt.
The Essenes of Egypt were divided into two sects; the <em>practical</em>
Essenes, whose mode of life was the same as those of Palestine; and the
<em>contemplative</em> Essenes, who were called <em>Therapeutæ</em>. Both sects maintained
the same doctrines; but the latter were distinguished by a more
rigid mode of life. It has been suggested by Taylor, the editor of
‘Calmet’s Dictionary of the Bible,’ that John the Baptist belonged to
this sect.</p></div>

Or Engedi. Its ancient name was Hazezon-Tamar, when it was
inhabited by the Amorites. See Gen. xiv. 7; 2 Chron. xx. 2. According
to Josephus, it gave name to one of the fifteen toparchies of Judæa.
It still retains its name, Ain-Jedey, or “Fountain of the Goats,” and
was so called from a spring which issued out of the limestone rock at the
base of a lofty cliff.</p></div>

Previously called Beth-shan. It was the next city of the Decapolis
in magnitude after Damascus. It was situate in the land of the tribe of
Issachar, though it belonged to the Manasites. At this place the bodies
of Saul and his sons were hung up by the Philistines; see 1 Sam. xxxi.
10-12. Reland suggests that it received the name of Scythopolis, not
from a Scythian colony, but from the Succoth of Gen. xxxiii. 17, which

comprised the Decapolis, standing about five miles south of Scythopolis,
or Beth-shan. Its exact site seems not to have been ascertained; but it

Of this place nothing is known; but it is most probable that the

writer, it was thirty-five miles from Pella. Its site is marked by extensive
ruins, thirty-five miles east of the Jordan, known by the name
of Gerash, and on the borders of the Great Desert of the Hauvan. According

famous for the worship paid by its inhabitants to Astarte, the Syrian
Aphrodite. A temple was erected here to Alexander the Great, in
which Alexander Severus, the Roman Emperor, was born, his parents
having resorted thither to celebrate a festival, <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> 205. From this circumstance,
its name was changed to Cæsarea. Burckhardt fixes its site

is in the Book of Judges, i. 31. It is supposed that it was Ptolemy I.,
the son of Lagus, who enlarged it and gave it the name of Ptolemais.
Its citadel, however, still retained the name of Ace. Under the Romans,
Ptolemais, as mentioned by Pliny, was a colony, and belonged to Galilee.

Nicator, who gave it its name, after his wife Apama. It also bore the
Macedonian name of Pella. It was situate on a hill, and was so far surrounded
by the windings of the Orontes, as to become a peninsula, whence
its name of Chersonesus. Very extensive ruins of this place still exist.</p></div>

does not arise from similar causes, nor are the same results produced by
it, seeing that the river does not convey the same volume of water as the
Nile, and that the country in the vicinity of its bed does not, like Egypt,
form a valley pent up between two ranges of hills.</p></div>

The sites of Thynos and Zephyrium appear to be unknown. Anchiale
was situate on the coast, upon the river Anchialeus, according to the
geographer Stephanus. Aristobulus, quoted by Strabo, says that at this
place was the tomb of Sardanapalus, and on it a relief in stone representing
a man snapping the fingers of the right hand. He adds,
“It is said that there is an Assyrian inscription also, recording that Sardanapalus
built Anchiale and Tarsus in one day, and exhorting the reader
to eat, drink, &amp;c., as everything else is not worth That, the meaning of
which was shown by the attitude of the figure.” Athenæus however
cites Amyntas as his authority for stating that the tomb of Sardanapalus
was at Nineveh. Leake is of opinion that a mound on the banks of the

as the birth-place of the Stoic philosopher Chrysippus, the comic
poet Philemon, and the poet and astronomer Aratus. Its name is perpetuated

descending it, the ground was found full of shrubs, both evergreens and

that there was a cave which contained a large spring, from which arose a
river of clear water which immediately afterwards sank into the earth
and flowed underground into the sea. It was called the Bitter Water.
This cave, so famed in ancient times, does not appear to have been

Pisidia was a mountainous region formed by that part of the main

the shore of the Pamphylian Gulf; the shore itself at the foot of the
mountains forming the district of Pamphylia. On the south-east it was

where he says that this inland sea commences to be called the <em>Caspian</em>
after you have passed the river Cyrus (or Kúr), and that the Caspii live
near it; and in C. 16, that it is called the <em>Hyrcanian</em> Sea, from the Hyrcani
who live along its shores. The western side would therefore in
strictness be called the <em>Caspian</em>, and the eastern the <em>Hyrcanian</em> Sea.</p></div>

“The name of Imaüs was, in the first instance, applied by the Greek

name was gradually extended to the intersection running north and south,
the meridian axis of Central Asia, or the <em>Bolor</em> range. The divisions of
Asia into ‘intra et extra Imaum,’ were unknown to Strabo and Pliny,
though the latter describes the knot of mountains formed by the intersections
of the Himâlaya, the Hindú-Kúsh, and Bolor, by the expression
‘quorum (Montes Emodi) promontorium Imaüs vocatur.’ The Bolor

“Strabo gives this name to only the eastern portion of the Caucasian
chain which overhangs the Caspian Sea and forms the northern
boundary of Albania, and in which he places the Amazons. Mela seems
to apply the name to the whole chain which other writers call Caucasus,
confining the latter term to a part of it. Pliny (B. v. c. <a href="#BOOK_V_CHAP_27">27</a> &amp; B. vi. c. 11) gives
precisely the same representation, with the additional error of
making the Ceraunii (<em>i. e.</em> the Caucasus of others) part of the Great
Taurus Chain. He seems to apply the name of Caucasus to the spurs
which spread out both to the north-east and the south-east from the
main chain near its eastern extremity, and which he regarded as a continuous
range, bordering the western shores of the Caspian. See B. vi.
c. 10.”—<em>Dr. Smith’s Dictionary of Ancient Geography.</em></p></div>

See B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_110">110</a>. The flame which continually burned on this mountain
has been examined by Beaufort, the modern traveller. The name of
the mountain is now Yanar: it is formed of a mass of scaglia with serpentine.
Spratt says that the flame is nothing more than a stream of
inflammable gas issuing from a crevice, such as is seen in several places
in the Apennines. By Homer it is represented as a fabulous monster,
which is explained by Servius, the commentator of Virgil, in the following
manner. He says that flames issue from the top of the mountain, and
that there are lions in the vicinity; the middle part abounds in goats,
and the lower part with serpents. Simena appears to be unknown.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_3898" href="#FNanchor_3898" class="label">3898</a>
So called from <span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἥφαιστος</span>, the Greek name of Vulcan. Pliny mentions
this spot also in B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_110">110</a>. The flame probably proceeded from
an inflammable gas, or else was ignited by a stream of naphtha.</p></div>

<p><a id="Footnote_3899" href="#FNanchor_3899" class="label">3899</a>
More generally known as Phœnicus, a flourishing city on Mount
Olympus; now Yanar Dagh, a volcano on the eastern coast of Lycia, with
which it often exchanged names. Having become the head-quarters of
the pirates, it was destroyed by the Roman general Servilius Isauricus.
Its ruins are to be seen at a spot called Deliktash.</p></div>

Mentioned again in B. xxxvi. c. 34, as the spot whence the <em>gagates
lapis</em> or ‘agate’ took its name. The ruins at Aladja are regarded by
Leake as marking the site of Gagæ; but Sir Charles Fellowes identifies
the place with the modern village of Hascooe, the vicinity of which is
covered with ruins.</p></div>

Now Andraki. This was the port of Myra, next mentioned. It stood
at the mouth of the river now known as the Andraki. Cramer observes
that it was here St. Paul was put on board the ship of Alexandria, Acts
xxvii. 5, 6.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3906" href="#FNanchor_3906" class="label">3906</a>
Still called Myra by the Greeks, but Dembre by the Turks. It was
built on a rock twenty stadia from the sea. St. Paul touched here on his
voyage as a prisoner to Rome, and from the mention made of it in Acts
xxvii. 5, 6, it would appear to have been an important sea-port. There
are magnificent ruins of this city still to be seen, in part hewn out of the
solid rock.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3907" href="#FNanchor_3907" class="label">3907</a>
From an inscription found by Cockerell at the head of the Hassac
Bay, it is thought that <em>Aperlæ</em> is the proper name of this place, though
again there are coins of Gordian which give the name as <em>Aperræ</em>. It is
fixed by the Stadismus as sixty stadia west of Somena, which Leake supposes
to be the same as the Simena mentioned above by Pliny.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3908" href="#FNanchor_3908" class="label">3908</a>
Now called Antephelo or Andifilo, on the south coast of Lycia, at
the head of a bay. Its theatre is still complete, with the exception of
the proscenium. There are also other interesting remains of antiquity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3909" href="#FNanchor_3909" class="label">3909</a>
Fellowes places the site of Phellos near a village called <em>Saaret</em>, west-north-west
of Antiphellos, where he found the remains of a town; but
Spratt considers this to mark the site of the Pyrra of Pliny, mentioned
above—judging from Pliny’s words. Modern geographers deem it more
consistent with his meaning to look for Phellos north of Antiphellos than
in any other direction, and the ruins at Tchookoorbye, north of Antiphellos,
on the spur of a mountain called Fellerdagh, are thought to be
those of Phellos.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3910" href="#FNanchor_3910" class="label">3910</a>
The most famous city of Lycia. It stood on the western bank of the
river of that name, now called the Echen Chai. It was twice besieged,
and on both occasions the inhabitants destroyed themselves with their
property, first by the Persians under Harpagus, and afterwards by the
Romans under Brutus. Among its most famous temples were those of
Sarpedon and of the Lycian Apollo. The ruins now known by the name
of Gunik, have been explored by Sir C. Fellows and other travellers,
and a portion of its remains are now to be seen in the British Museum,
under the name of the Xanthian marbles.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3911" href="#FNanchor_3911" class="label">3911</a>
Its ruins still bear the same name. It was a flourishing seaport, on
a promontory of the same name, sixty stadia east of the mouth of the
Xanthus. It was early colonized by the Dorians from Crete, and became
a chief seat of the worship of Apollo, from whose son Patarus it was said
to have received its name. Ptolemy Philadelphus enlarged it, and called it Arsinoë, but
it still remained better known by its old name. This
place was visited by St. Paul, who thence took ship for Phœnicia. See
Acts xxi. 1.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3912" href="#FNanchor_3912" class="label">3912</a>
This was more properly the name of a mountain district of Lycia.
Strabo speaks of Cragus, a mountain with eight summits, and a city of
the same name. Beaufort thinks that Yedy-Booroon, the Seven Capes,
a group of high and rugged mountains, appear to have been the ancient
Mount Cragus of Lycia.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3913" href="#FNanchor_3913" class="label">3913</a>
Probably the Gulf of Macri, equal in size to the Gulf of Satalia,
which is next to it.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3914" href="#FNanchor_3914" class="label">3914</a>
This place lay in the interior at the base of Cragus, and its ruins are
still to be seen on the east side of the range, about half-way between
Telmessus and the termination of the range on the south coast.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3915" href="#FNanchor_3915" class="label">3915</a>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3916" href="#FNanchor_3916" class="label">3916</a>
Its site is unknown. That of Candyba has been ascertained to be a
place called Gendevar, east of the Xanthus, and a few miles from the coast.
Its rock-tombs are said to be beautifully executed. The Œnian grove or
forest, it has been suggested, may still be recognized in the extensive
pine forest that now covers the mountain above the city. The sites of
Podalia and Choma seem to be unknown.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3917" href="#FNanchor_3917" class="label">3917</a>
In some editions “Cyane.” Leake says that this place was discovered
to the west of Andriaca by Cockerell. It appears from Scott and Forbes’s
account of Lycia, that three sites have been found between port Tristorus
and the inland valley of Kassabar, which from the inscriptions appeared
anciently to have borne this name, Yarvoo, Ghiouristan, and Toussa.
The former is the chief place and is covered with ruins of the Roman and
middle-age construction. At Ghiouristan there are Lycian rock-tombs.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3918" href="#FNanchor_3918" class="label">3918</a>
Its ruins are to be seen near the modern Doover, in the interior of
Lycia, about two miles and a half east of the river Xanthus. Of the
three places previously mentioned the sites appear to be unknown.</p></div>

Its site is fixed at Katara, on both sides of the Katara Su, the most
northern branch of the Xanthus. The ruins are very considerable, lying
on both sides of the stream. Balbura is a neuter plural.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3921" href="#FNanchor_3921" class="label">3921</a>
It lay to the west of Balbura, near a place now called Ebajik, on a small
stream that flows into the Horzoom Tchy. In B. xxxv. c. 17, Pliny
mentions a kind of chalk found in the vicinity of this place. Its ruins
are still to be seen, but they are not striking.</p></div>

Situate in the district of Caria called Peræa. It was also the name
given to a mountainous district. In Hoskyn’s map the ruins of Dædala
are placed near the head of the Gulf of Glaucus, on the west of a small
river called Inegi Chai, probably the ancient Ninus, where Dædalus was
bitten by a water-snake, in consequence of which he died.</p></div>

Placed by Strabo sixty stadia from the sea, west of the Gulf of
Glaucus, and east of Carinus. Its site is uncertain, but it may possibly
be the place discovered by Fellows, which is proved by inscriptions to
have been called Cadyanda, a name otherwise unknown to us. This lies N.N.E. of Makri,
on the Gulf of Glaucus or Makri, at a place called
Hoozoomlee, situate on an elevated plain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3931" href="#FNanchor_3931" class="label">3931</a>
The same as the river Calbis of Strabo and Mela, at present the
Dalamon Tchy, Quingi or Taas, having its sources in Mount Cadmus
above Cibyra. It was said to have derived its name from an Indian, who
had been thrown into it from an elephant.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3932" href="#FNanchor_3932" class="label">3932</a>
Their district was Cibyratis, of which the chief city was Cibyra.
This place, uniting with the towns of Balbura, Bubon, and Œnianda,
had the name of Tetrapolis; of which league Cibyra was the head, mustering
30,000 infantry and 2000 cavalry. The iron found in this district
was easily cut with a chisel or other sharp tool. The site of this powerful
city has been ascertained to be at Horzoom, on the Horzoom Tchy,
a branch of the Dalamon Tchy or Indus. The ruins are very extensive,
and the theatre in fine preservation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3933" href="#FNanchor_3933" class="label">3933</a>
Placed by Strabo west of Calynda. The ancient descriptions of its
locality vary, but the place now known as Kaiguez is said to denote its
site. The Caunii are frequently mentioned in the Persian, Grecian, and
Roman histories. It was noted for its dried figs, mentioned by Pliny in
B. xv. c. 19.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3941" href="#FNanchor_3941" class="label">3941</a>
There was a town of this name as well. Stephen of Byzantium

Podalirius, when shipwrecked on the coast of Caria.</p></div>

Part of it was situate on an island now called Cape Krio, connected
by a causeway with the mainland. Its site is covered with ruins of a
most interesting character in every direction. The Triopian promontory,
evidently alluded to by Pliny, is the modern Cape Krio.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3943" href="#FNanchor_3943" class="label">3943</a>
It has been remarked that in his description here Pliny is very brief

to the small peninsula or island, or may include in this term the western
part of the whole of the larger peninsula.</p></div>

On the Lycus, now known as the Choruk-Su. By different writers
it has been assigned to Lydia, Caria, and Phrygia, but in the ultimate
division of the Roman provinces it was assigned to the Greater Phrygia.
It was founded by Antiochus II. on the site of a previous town, and
named in honour of his wife Laodice. Its site is occupied by ruins of
great magnificence. In the Apostolic age it was the seat of a flourishing
Christian Church, which however very soon gave signs of degeneracy,
as we learn from St. John’s Epistle to it, Revel. ii. 14-22. St. Paul also
addresses it in common with the neighbouring church of Colossæ. Its
site is now called Eski-Hissar, or the Old Castle.</p></div>

The people of Hierapolis, a town of Phrygia, situate on a height between
the rivers Lycus and Mæander, about five miles north of Laodicea,
on the road from Apamea to Sardis. It was celebrated for its warm
springs, and its Plutonium, or cave of Pluto, from which issued a mephitic
vapour of a poisonous nature; see B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_95">95</a>. The Christian
Church here is alluded to by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians, iv. 13.

Situate in the north of Phrygia Salutaris; its ruins being probably
those to be seen at Afiour-Kara-Hisar. From the time of Constantine
this place became the capital of Phrygia Salutaris. It stood in a fruitful
plain, near a mountain quarry of the celebrated Synnadic marble, which
was white with red veins and spots. This marble was also called “Docimiticus,”
from Docimia, a nearer place.</p></div>

Eucarpia was a town of Phrygia, not far from the sources of the
Mæander, on the road from Dorylæum to Apamea Cibotus. The vine
grew there in great luxuriance, and to its fruitfulness the town probably
owed its name. Kiepert places it in the vicinity of Segielar, but its exact
site is unknown.</p></div>

This place was built near Celænæ by Antiochus Soter, and named
after his mother Apama. Strabo says that it lay at the mouth of the
river Marsyas. Its site has been fixed at the modern Denair. Some
ancient ruins are to be seen.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_3957" href="#FNanchor_3957" class="label">3957</a>

Apamea, though close to it.</p></div>

Meaning the “Fountains of the Pipe,” and probably deriving its
name from the legend here mentioned by Pliny, and in B. xvi. c. 44.
Strabo describes the Marsyas and Mæander as rising, according to report,
in one lake above Celænæ, which produced reeds adapted for making the
mouth-pieces of musical instruments, but he gives no name to the lake.
Hamilton found near Denair or Apamea, a lake nearly two miles in circumference,
full of reeds and rushes, which he looks upon as the lake on
the mountain Aulocrene, described by Pliny in the 31st Chapter of the present Book.
His account however is very confused, as he mentions on
different occasions a <em>region</em> of Aulocrene, a <em>valley</em> of Aulocrene, and a

Again mentioned by Pliny in B. xi. c. 80. Scepsis was an ancient
city in the interior of the Troad, south-east of Alexandria, in the mountains
of Ida. Its inhabitants were removed by Antigonus to Alexandria;
but being permitted by Lysimachus to return to their homes, they built
a new city, and the remains of the old town were then called Palæscepsis.
This place is famous in literary history for being the spot where certain

lay at the foot of the wooden figure, the work of Scopas. According to

It is not exactly known whether <em>New</em> Ilium was built on the same
site as the Ilium or Troy which had been destroyed by the Greeks; but
it has been considered improbable that the exploits mentioned in the
Iliad should have happened in so short a space as that lying between the
later Ilium and the coast. The site of New Ilium is generally considered
to be the spot covered with ruins, now called Kissarlik, between the

Pergamus, and situate in the Teuthranian district of Mysia, on the
northern bank of the river Caïcus. Under its kings, its library almost
equalled that of Alexandria, and the formation of it gave rise to the invention
of parchment, as a writing material, which was thence called
<em>Charta Pergamena</em>. This city was an early seat of Christianity, and is
one of the seven churches of Asia to whom the Apocalyptic Epistles are

than one city of this name in Cyprus, which was probably bestowed on
them during its subjection to the princes of the line of Lagus. Another
Arsinoë is placed near Ammochostus to the north of the island, and a

Near a small stream, which seems to enter the Sangarius. It originally
belonged to Phrygia, and its mythical founder was Midas, the
son of Gordius, who was said to have found an anchor on the spot, and
accordingly given the name to the town; which story would, however,
as it has been observed, imply that the name for anchor (<span lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ἄγκυρα</span>) was the
same in the Greek and the Phrygian languages. The Tectosages, who
settled here about <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 277, are supposed to have been from the neighbourhood
of Toulouse. It is now called Angora, or Engareh; and the
fine hair of the Angora goat may have formed one of the staple commodities
of the place, which had a very considerable trade. The chief
monument of antiquity here is the marble temple of the Emperor
Augustus, built in his honour during his lifetime. In the inside is the
Latin inscription known as the <em>monumentum</em>, or <em>marmor Ancyranum</em>,
containing a record of the memorable actions of Augustus. The ruins
here are otherwise interesting in a high degree.</p></div>

Its ruins are to be seen at Iznik, on the east side of the lake of that
name. Its site is supposed to have been originally occupied by the town
of Attæa, and afterwards by a settlement of the Bottiæans, called Ancore,
or Helicore, which was destroyed by the Mysians. On this spot, shortly
after the death of Alexander the Great, Antigonus built a city which
he named after himself, Antigonæa; but Lysimachus soon afterwards
changed the name into Nicæa, in honour of his wife. Under the kings
of Bithynia, it was often the royal residence, and it long disputed with
Nicomedia the rank of capital of Bithynia. The modern Iznik is only
a poor village, with about 100 houses. Considerable ruins of the ancient city are still
in existence. Littré seems to think that there are two
Nicæas meant in these passages; but it would seem that the same place
is alluded to in both lines. The only thing that seems to give countenance
to Littré’s supposition (in which he is supported by Hardouin)
is, the expression “Et Prusa <em>item</em> altera.”</p></div>

It has been suggested, that this is only another name for the town

to the territory of Heraclea, but was conquered by King Prusias, who
named it after himself. It stood to the north-west of the other Prusa.</p></div>

The Roman emperor, grandson of Livia, the wife of Augustus. As
an author, the character in which he is here referred to, he occupied himself
chiefly with history, and was encouraged in the pursuit by Livy the
historian. At an early age he began to write a history from the death
of the Dictator Cæsar, a plan which he afterwards abandoned, and began
his work with the restoration of peace, after the battle of Actium. Of
the earlier period he had written only four books, but the latter work he
extended to forty-four. He also wrote memoirs of his own life, which
Suetonius describes as written with more silliness than inelegance. A
fourth work was a defence of Cicero against the attacks of Asinius Pollio.
He also wrote histories of Carthage and of Etruria in Greek. All of his
literary works have perished.</p></div>

Juba II., king of Mauritania. After the defeat of his father at

compelled to grace the conqueror’s triumph. Augustus Cæsar afterwards
restored to him his kingdom, and gave him in marriage Cleopatra,
or Selene, the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra. To his literary pursuits
he is chiefly indebted for his reputation. His works are continually
quoted by Pliny, who regards his authority with the utmost deference.

There are four literary persons mentioned of this name. 1. An
Athenian comic poet of the middle comedy. 2. A native of Maronæa,
in Thrace, or else of Crete, who wrote lascivious and abusive verses, and
was at last put to death by order of Ptolemy Philadelphus. He was the
inventor of the Sotadean verse, or Ionic a Majore, Tetrameter Brachycatalectic.
3. An Athenian philosopher, who wrote a book on mysteries.
4. A Byzantine philosopher, of whom nothing whatever is known.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4406" href="#FNanchor_4406" class="label">4406</a>
There were two writers of this name, before the time of Pliny. 1. Periander of
Corinth, one of the Seven Wise Men, who wrote a didactic
poem, containing moral and political precepts, in 2000 lines; and, 2. a
physician and bad poet, contemporary with Archidamas, the son of
Agesilaüs. It is uncertain to which Pliny here refers.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4407" href="#FNanchor_4407" class="label">4407</a>

The author of the Periplus, or voyage which he performed round a part
of Libya, of which we have a Greek translation from the Punic original.
His age is not known, but Pliny states (B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_67">67</a>, and B. v. c. <a href="#BOOK_V_CHAP_1">1</a>) that
the voyage was undertaken in the most flourishing days of Carthage. It
has been considered on the whole, that he may be probably identified
with Hanno, the son or the father of Hamilcar, who was slain at
Himera, <span class="smcap lowercase">B.C.</span> 480.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_4414" href="#FNanchor_4414" class="label">4414</a>
Mentioned also by Pliny, B. ii. c. <a href="#BOOK_II_CHAP_67">67</a>, as having conducted a voyage
of discovery from Gades towards the north, along the western shores of
Europe, at the same time that Hanno proceeded on his voyage along the
western coast of Africa. He is repeatedly quoted by Festus Avienus, in
his geographical poem called <em>Ora Maritima</em>. His voyage is said to have
lasted four months, but it is impossible to judge how far it extended.</p></div>

A Greek geographer, and friend of Seleucus Nicator, by whom he
was sent on an embassy to Sandrocottus, king of the Prasii, whoso
capital was Palibothra, a town probably in the vicinity of the present
Patna. Whether he had accompanied Alexander on his invasion of
India is quite uncertain. He wrote a work on India in four books, to
which the subsequent Greek writers were chiefly indebted for their
accounts of India. Arrian speaks highly of him as a writer, but Strabo
impeaches his veracity; and we find Pliny hinting the same in B. vi.
c. 21. Of his work only a few fragments survive.</p></div>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
